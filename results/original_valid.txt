before fixing a fire place 's <UNK> you must have the right tools first .
then you need to inspect the fireplace in sections .

the finale of the fireworks show was extravagant .
we decided to do some of our own fireworks in our porch .
it was not a good idea to do our own fireworks because a small fire almost started .
this firework is original in that the different colored lights snake out from the center .
when several fireworks go off at the same time , it 's hard to appreciate the beauty of each one
sometimes the fireworks can be so brilliant they almost resemble the sun .
after the show , we decided to set off the small personal fireworks we purchased .

we were very excited to explore the nearby forest .
we entered the field and ran quickly to the forest edge .
we stopped at a river in the woods and watched the fish go past .

we ran across a creek .
we followed the creek uphill .

so we did , and man , is location location location weird . the gate itself is enough to freak
but once you get through , it 's a great park .
and even though it 's in location . it reminds me of parks in the location .
actually though i was kinda glad to get out of there and take a walk down by the pier to
the night sky is really remarkable when lit by the city .
the bridge also has a wonderful lighting layout .

this was the perfect way to calm down .
i went to a concert last night .
the band playing was jamming a good tune .
the singer of the other band was great .
the men on the drum set were very talented .

the drummer beats along to the music getting ready for his solo .
the crowd cheers on the drummer as he goes off on his drum solo leaving the crowd happy .
the band was excited and a bit anxious to start their first performance .

it was only a minute into the song when the lead singer got enough courage to really start giving his

some fireworks go off at the same time and there are many fireworks in the sky .
there are also blue fireworks .
some of the prettiest fireworks are bright green .
sometimes three fireworks can be seen in the sky .
who does n't love fireworks ? this one looks like a <UNK> palm tree !
although beautiful , it 's a bit scary when they fire off too close to the ground .
this one reminds me of a christmas ornament !
when they break apart , they look like little <UNK> bugs .
the big red in your face fireworks are the best !
last night 's fireworks show blew me away . this red flower type burst was amazing . it filled the
i liked these lower down <UNK> color displays , too .
this one looked like a big <UNK> pop in the sky .
this green one reminded me of trailing <UNK> .
and these subtle bursts were great . it was a top notch show .
bursts of fire reminded the crowd of what the 4th was about .
the explosions sounded like cannon explosions .
those explosions reminded people that battles has occurred to ensure their freedom .
small , quieter explosions seems almost somber given the <UNK> .
a large final display reminded the crowd of the pride that the citizens of the location had in their history

the other bird was more white and would not let us even get close to see if the other was

we ended the day with a ride on the organization organization .
the day at location location for the jones ' started with the tilt-a-whirl .
next they went on the cyclone , a famous coaster that set the dad 's teeth on edge .
the kids begged to go on the drop dive , which delivers a sheer drop from 70 feet .
tired , they searched for a bathroom but all were out of order .
finally , they found some public restrooms near the beach , and settled in for the afternoon .
today we took the family to location park !
there was plenty of entertainment for the kids .
as well as some more grown up activities for the adults .
the turn out was massive with thousands upon thousands of people .

there was also a freak show which was very interesting .
a lot of people crowded the beach . it was a hot day but cool by the water .
this was a great <UNK> will be remembered forever .
i visited a theme park this summer .
they had some smaller thrill rides .
they also had some carnival games .
the park was in a large city with many big buildings .
it was also near a rather crowded beach .
we started the day with my favorite ride .
i love roller coasters too .
sometimes we had to sit down & rest .
we were not happy to see this sign .
so it was off to the beach where we did n't need a bathroom & no one noticed .
i had a great time at the beach .
there were a ton of people out on the beach walking around .
i went to a restaurant at night .
then i did a little shopping .
i bought some sweets as well .
we had a great time on the 4th hanging with some friends out by the location location location .
the pier was bustling with people , but we managed to go on a few of the rides .
as you can imagine , the beach was a zoo , but it sure beat the valley heat .
once the sun went down , everything cooled off , and soon the fireworks show began .
the pier is also a really happening place for entertainment , and you 'll always be sure to find many
i <UNK> places from my childhood . like the bench that i sat on next to the beach as i
there was the ferris wheel nearby , which i rode on so many times .
i next went down to the beach and got my feet wet .
i returned to the bench and watched the sun set over the city skyline .
i then went to work and started <UNK> for a living .
my day to start with some relaxing on a bench while enjoying the view .
then i plan to go to the beach to relax some more .

followed by a little shopping .
ending this great , relaxing day with a treat .
the family took a nice trip to the beach .
they saw an enormous organization organization .
they even got to see all the people on the beach .
when the sun fell , they could see the beautiful colors on the skyline .
they traveled to the shops and thought about the great day they had .
we took the train going anywhere . it was great .
the fountain square was neat to see up close .
this dragon is on the side of the fountain . off to another adventure .
going to go tour this area and see what we can find .
this angel is overlooking the square . she 's a little weird .
on my trip in location , we took the tram .
there were a lot of signs .
in this city , we loved the statues !
the architecture was amazing , too .
a lot of the statues were beautiful .
our mini vacation took us on some rail rides . neither one of us had ever been on any <UNK>
i liked the sign that <UNK> `` discover the world '' because that was what we were doing on our
the angel statues were incredibly lifelike , but all i could think was about those dr. who <UNK> of the
the architecture was old and grand . we spent hours exploring the biggest buildings .
this angel statue looked lonely and somewhat ominous set against the background of the steel gray sky .
we went on a train to visit a local place .
we got off the stop and looked around the city .
we hung around a famous fountain .
we decided to check out the local temple .
we took a photo of the city 's most famous statue as our final stop .
a train tour offered the chance to get a look at many different <UNK> .
here , the travelers spotted a beautiful old fountain .
the detailing on the carvings was unbelievable .
they eventually came to their intended destination .
they made time to observe one final intricate statue before moving on with their day .
arriving at the estate , we were greeted by a beautiful water feature .
we had to take the location location all the way from one side of the estate to the other .
slowly we traveled along the lonely rail .
midway , we had to stop for a few minutes for pictures and a <UNK> .
down below in the garden , everything was ready for our arrival .
a family decided to go to the local amusement park .
the amusement park was becoming crowded .
there were a lot of rides .
the family rode the roller coaster together .
the park was surrounded by a beautiful waterfall .
an easy way to get around the park was to use transportation .
this ride took fans from one side to the other .
slowly it climbed as it crossed roads and passersby below .
the ornate detailing of the car made it fun to be in .
it ended with a large sculpture indicating they 'd reached the end .
the family arrived at their hotel .
`` and best of all , '' said the dad `` there is a roller coaster in our hotel ''
the kids cheered and ran off to ride it .
they yelled and screamed the whole way .
and when they saw the big monster at the end , they screamed and hid .
we arrived at the amusement park early in the morning .
we wanted to get there early so we would n't have to wait on long lines to get on the
we rode on a pretty neat <UNK> tram that took us from one end of the park to another .
then it was time to get on a rollercoaster in the shape of a train . it was so scary
the coaster went under a waterfall and we all got wet . we decided to get some food and take
the observatory had n't been used in a while .
most people go to the lookout tower .
after looking up i quickly decided to stay on the ground .
the sun was beginning to set and soon we would be able to enjoy the night starts .
the beauty we were about to see was introduced by the beauty of this sunset .
while we were traveling we came across a strange building and went to investigate .
we saw a large observation tower in the back .
we decided to take a closer look and see if we can reach the top .
after some debate we climbed to the top for a better view .
at the top we witnessed a very beautiful sunset .
today we visited a special place of my parents ' .
after walking through the gates , we saw a huge tower in the distance .
the tower seemed to grow taller as we got closer .
we saw that it had a million steps to get to the top .
after climbing the steps , we stayed and watched the sunset .
visiting the local observatory was quite a treat .
these communication towers towered over the landscape .
it took a lot of steps to get to the top of this tower .
as the sun set the sky was <UNK> with beauty .
there is no better way to end a day than with a sight like this .
we explored the observatory this afternoon .
since it was daylight , we approached a tower to see the sky .
as we got closer we saw how tall it was .
when we were at the base , we saw how <UNK> it looked .
however , the view and sunset was <UNK> .
we decided to visit location location in location .
when we first arrived , we walked through the town and saw how people used to live .
we also spent some time walking through several of the beautiful gardens .
there was a very old ship that was docked in the harbor and we got to take a guided tour
it was amazing to see everything that was on display throughout the town . it was a great day learning
when we got to the city , we took a picture of the town sign .
down the sand road , we saw the water .
near the road , there was a home where we would be staying for the weekend .
the carriages were so classy .
they led us down this beautiful forest road .
today was the day the family learned some american history at college creek .
they had replicas of everything , ready for a reenactment at the drop of a hat .
i love the way the grass was cut , it looked like there were tiny rows in the lawns .
there was n't any water around , so they built a replica of a ship that was used during the
last of all , we got to see some of the guns that were used buy the <UNK> !
the day started with a trip to college <UNK> was a tour starting at the main house .
we rode a horse and wagon throughout the quaint village .
the gardens were peaceful and beautiful . surrounded by a white gate .
the highlight of the tour was the actual tour of a ship docked on location location .
inside the ship was exciting . lots of historical objects including a collection of <UNK> n't wait to go back
on a recent road trip , i discovered a town called location location
where they live like it is the <UNK> 's with horses and wagons
and organic crops tended by hand .
my favorite part though was seeing the sailing ships they used for transportation and
viewing their <UNK> .
it was a beautiful day for trip to the beach .
when i had first arrived there are only a couple people th
after a few hours of playing in the ocean and building sandcastles at the beach started to fill up .
as i walk the beach i could n't help but notice the beautiful sale goes out in the ocean .
when we were all done at the beach we decided to hit the local amusement park for some extra fun
we went to the beach today .
we had a great time being down by the water .
so many people were they having such a good time .
it was a very bright day , i 'm glad i had my hat !
i had so much fun in the sand . i love the beach !
i am so happy to be at the beach today .
clear skies mean there will be plenty of sunshine .
it looks like a lot of people decided to come enjoy the water today .
there are a couple of boats to watch while i relax on the sand .
i am definitely riding that ride before i leave .
yesterday we took a trip to our local beach .
we spent a while playing in the coast 's warm waters .
the beach was crowded , but we still had a great time .
there were a lot of people out boating that we could see from the shore .
eventually , we called it a day and headed to the organization organization .
on vacation at the beach down in location location with my wife !
we hit the beach first , and there were n't many people there , fortunately .
later on , the crowds came , and we decided it was too much for us .
we left and took a small boat across the water .
we ended up at this place in location location . not sure what it is , but it 's the
we walked through the city to see what stores were there .
some of the building signs were in english .
we took pictures of the city from the water .
we were in awe of the beautiful lights <UNK> from the city .
at the end of the night , we enjoyed the fireworks .
this sign <UNK> the attitude that i have been taking since we arrived in this strange country .
coming in on a small boat , this <UNK> mass was an unexpected sight .
just off the coast of the mainland , this is where the evil <UNK> lives .
at night , the lights become fantastic -- dimly lit 24 hours a day by the strange <UNK> down below
and at midnight , the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at all his enemies !
we set up the fireworks display at the tallest building in town .
we also did one at another location across from the first building .
we then sat back across the river and waited .
when night came , all the lights on the buildings came on .
we started the fireworks display .
my job has me take pictures of various buildings .
here is one of my hotel i will be staying at for the night .
i 've been <UNK> with taking pictures of this tomorrow night for the festival .
the city looks wonderful at night and things are about to get started .
what a wonderful firework show the festival had at the very end .
a person spent the day in the city on the 4th of july .
the person admired the architecture of the nearby buildings .
a small abandoned pier made for a scenic picture .
as the sun set , the city came alive with color .
shortly <UNK> , a large display of fireworks was shown .
the wooden creature man i created from the chest up .
here i am holding my creation on a beautiful day .
the full body of my creation appears to be floating .
the details of my creation are seen here in a close up picture .
the wooden creation man 's head is lit up perfectly behind the sun .
the giant stick man will conquer all the humans .
he stands <UNK> on his mound of <UNK> .
this <UNK> center is the source all of his power .
all <UNK> the giant stick creature !
it is really just <UNK> created by this girl .
entered my first sculpture into the local art gallery .
it was a statue made of wood .
i put a lot of effort into building it .
it was time <UNK> to cut and fit each piece perfectly together .
but after 4 long months i finally had it finished and just in time to enter it .
they had driven out to location just for this !
[female] posed with it , pretending to hold the legs .
they admired the feat of creating something so large .
but wondered what the intent of it really was .
either way , it looked cool !
[female] had to build a puppet for school project .
she was very proud about it when she finished .
she used wood sticks and built a 3d puppet .
her design was slick and the end result was professional .
[female] received a special mention for her fantastic 3d model puppet .
okay , i was a little intoxicated when i decided to ride this organization organization .
i soon figured out that this was a bad idea . i decided to hop off the thing , and
i found a taxi to take me home , and told them to take the fastest route out .
i looked back at the wheel in the sky , while it grew smaller in the distance .
some day i may return to you organization organization . until then , we had our moment .
from far away the ferris wheel looked simply incredible .
even though the first color scheme was impressive , as our boat drew closer it displayed an even cooler color
as the boat rounded the harbor i was able to get a full shot of all of the buildings ,
as we were leaving the harbor once more the ferris wheel turned a welcoming blue color , as if to
i said goodbye to the lovely peer , our ferry now chugging on into the night .
the blue light on the wheel was mesmerizing .
when the light turned green i was completely speechless .
the city at night time is <UNK> dropping .
the reflection on the lake made the scene really unique .
i decided to make the last photo my <UNK> .
the ferris wheel shone bright over the water .
[male] and [female] kissed in front of it , and a stranger snapped their picture .
they looked out across the lake , feeling happy and content .
they had a big day exploring and were ready to get home .
so off they went towards their hotel .
at night the ferris wheel came alive .
the colors drew the attention of crowds from all over the area .
the ride <UNK> in color throughout the night , changing from one to another and back again .
the reflection on the water appeared almost magical .

location location had the most unique water tower !
this is where we decided to stop and eat ; they had the best <UNK> !
after lunch we had ice cream at this little shop .
this <UNK> shop had the <UNK> workers , but not a very big selection .

the adults get a shot of coffee for the long drive .

i saw the tallest tree i have ever seen before ,
at the base of the tree there were gifts for all the kids who believe in location .
i saw the prettiest ornament that was made of glass .
my present was a ornament that lit up when on a tree .

our favorite characters from finding nemo were there !
there were also great big roller coasters that we went on .
we bought little gifts at the gift shop to .
at the end , we enjoyed the lights at night .

time to wind down the busy day with a ferris wheel ride at night .
beautiful night to go the boardwalk .
the setting sun over the ocean was <UNK> by clouds . it 'll be dark soon anyway .
i love the boardwalk at night because the of the ferris wheel lights .
arrived at the beach the next morning and decided not to swim <UNK> warning .
there is now an animal exhibit on the boardwalk . i do n't think tigers like being near the water
i went to the fair with my kids last weekend .
there were a lot of people there .
they also had a barn .
we got to see a lot of animals .
we ca n't wait to go back later .
family day down at the petting zoo ! off to see all kinds of animals .
from a distance , we saw a goat <UNK> against a door . we had a few snacks , and
the goat said hello , may i have a snack , and we said of course !
later we observed a very <UNK> monkey , pondering amazing and deep things .
family day proved a success , with many new sights and sounds for the kids !
the child was having so much fun on the carousel .
his mother came to support her son , but he was distracted by a onlooker nearby .
hidden in the shed a goat spied on the child and made him uneasy .
startled by the goat the grandmother decided to take the child far away from the scary looking goat .
the mother and her son began to have more fun . so long as they stay away from the goat
we took an impromptu visit to the zoo with my son .
this goat was not in the mood to come out at all .
this one was a lot more friendly and posed for a picture !
this monkey was chilling and trying to stay away from the heat .
the day was perfect and my little man was very pleased with seeing all the animals .
[male] was ready for his first visit to the petting zoo ,
the barn was open and ready for [male] .
[male] was scared of this goat .
the monkey was relaxing not caring about what was going on .
[male] loved looking at all the animals
it was a great night at the plaza
the rooms lit up the night sky
and everyone wanted to be at the plaza
their were gift shops where you could buy stuff too
it was a wonderful time to stay at the hotel
we went on vacation and stayed at the location location hotel .
the outside of the building was very impressive .
we could n't believe they had a organization wheel .
the inside of the hotel was even more impressive then the outside .
we had never been to such a luxurious hotel .
the <UNK> plaza is a beautiful building .
the building is lit up and can be seen for miles .
it has a colorful organization organization with a breathtaking view .
the interior of the building is a another story .
it is nice to see buildings that are beautiful .
a smart part of the outside of the hotel that we stayed in on vacation .
i love the nights that we had there , wonderful food and great atmosphere .
enjoying a night ride on the ferris wheel .
our hotel lobby that we stayed at .
just some of the different views that we saw the past couple days .
there was a big ferris wheel
near location location .
the building was huge
and people had nice shirts .
there was a nice building near .
today was the day .
the big trip .
there were buildings .
crowded public places .
and a fountain .
the city was filled with old historic buildings and this one was amazing .
the people were gathered around the square to enjoy the city .
the center fountain was an attraction for all .
the statues near the building were amazing .
the building was a bright colorful orange with great attention to detail .
the outside of the building looked like a beautifully aged photograph .
so i was surprised to see how beautifully colored the inside was .
even the somewhat gray buildings had brilliant <UNK> of red .
we finally joined the crowed around the stage .
finally , i took a few minutes to enjoy the waterfall outside the building itself .
to understand who we were as a society it is important to visit historic locations .
each location has a timeless story to be told
or an important event that started a movement .
to <UNK> the past opens up opportunities for the future .
not to mention , taking in such locations can be equally as entertaining as learning about the location itself .
[male] was on a sightseeing tour for the first time .
location is a place full of history .
she loved taking pictures of the fountains .
some of the sculptures also caught her eye .
the architecture was fantastic . she had a wonderful time during her trip .
testing out my new camera downtown .
this is location . everybody here is so nice .
the quality of this new camera is amazing .
not sure what parade today is but this guy is all dressed up .
the color of this picture has to be the best picture i 've ever taken .
a couple take a trip to a town to have a vacation .
there are people in the streets that play music .
there are boaters and also boats that give boat rides .
there are attractions like ferris wheels to ride and other things to do to entertain .
there are palaces and buildings you can go in and explore . there are many things to see .
we attended the local festivities and were treated to a lot of local color and <UNK> .
this street performer captured our attention for a while .
the crowds loved this performer and took a lot of photos .
of course the festival would not have been complete without a <UNK> hat .

this was one of the local bands playing . we really had a good time .

the park today was a good choice ,
this guy is always playing the same song .
we saw some people in a boat and quickly became jealous .
he said do n't even think of getting on the ferris wheel .
so we , just went inside .
i had a great time at the church .
there were many beautiful windows .
it was a small building .
the church was great .
everything was very old .
we visited a local church that was being renovated this weekend .
the building is fairly small but has lots of detail .
we especially liked the front door , complete with antique key .
the stained glass was also impressive .
the interior looked like new , this was a great restoration and we will certainly visit again .
traveled with mom to visit this church . we were amazed by the art .
a closer look at the art inside the church .
the church mom wanted to tour on a trip .
the inside of the church is absolutely amazing . what was really astonishing was the lack of windows . it
who <UNK> the key to the church . you really do not want to get locked in .
i felt <UNK> to document these stained glass windows .
here is the glass over the alter .
this little church is not far from my house .
my parent 's were married here long ago .
even the door hardware is beautiful at this church .
stained glass was a love , a passion even .

she did it all from her small cottage .
churches , homes , businesses , she even did a dog house window once .
her husband did iron work .

we always drive around to see the lights for christmas .
we love seeing how the houses decorate .

there we so many art installations on the boardwalk that everyone loved .
the architecture was so different of street to street that it was amazing because you never knew if you were
after an incredible day of sight seeing we were so tuckered out , but we stopped back by the bridge

this is a great old cathedral . the photo does not do it justice !
the river at night is quite beautiful ! !
this <UNK> photo is cool . you can see the reflection in the piece of metal .
the band was playing to a jam packed crowd at the event .
the stage had great colors around the band .
the band member was jamming on his guitar .
at times the lights went out which created more mystery to the show .
the band member rejoiced to the crowd as they applauded .
at a rock concert
singing their number one hit .
playing a guitar solo .
playing a guitar solo with his dad .
thanking his fans for their support .
i am so pumped up for this night !
the screen sure helps to see because i 'm a little far back .
this seems like a better view , and i 'm having a great time !
could this get any cooler ?
i felt the same as everybody else and the performers that were having such a great time !
the concert started with a video ,
it went on throughout the concert ,
the music <UNK> all around the room .
then they turned the lights down ,
and started the real show .
came to the <UNK> theater to see my favorite band play .
this is him , playing his heart out . i try to imagine he 's singing just to me .
sing on , hear those pretty lyrics .
two guitars are better than one in this duet .
a final song just for me , i 'm glad i came to this concert .
location 's village was ready for visitors .
there were many location ornaments .

we started at the botanical gardens .
there where a lot of nice plants there .
next , we moved on to the christmas dolls .
the collections where pretty impressive .
we stopped by the tree before heading out .
we attended a christmas village today .
there were many stores .
the stores sold many location location dolls .
there was one of santa claus playing the violin .
they even sold his outfits !
every year we travel around to see all the christmas lights .
this tree looks so much different than when it is light up .
the decorations lining the streets were so pretty and different .
every lamp post was decorated in bright wreaths .
out of all the lights at christmas time , i liked this one the most .
christmas is a wonderful time of year
all the lights are beautiful
and the holiday cheer makes for incredible nights
the <UNK> get into the season
because they want more sales
christmas is a wonderful celebration .
usually , you can see christmas trees all over .
sometimes they show up in <UNK> or town centers . they are usually decorated with lights
and sometimes with colorful ornaments .
christmas is a special time of each year , decorations and all .
it was my favorite time of year , christmas .
the blue tree was very pretty this year , we all enjoyed seeing it .
looking down on the tree and all the lights makes one feel the spirit of christmas more .
the different color balls were festive .
all the shops had decorations on the walls .

the owner of one of the antique shops explained the importance of this piece .
he also said this piece is a rare artifact that can not be found anywhere .
we saw so many beautiful flowers that day . it <UNK> up the mood .
the flowers look ready to bloom fully .
the colors of the dragon for the chinese new year parade are astounding .
the figurine looks very life like .
this figurine captures the pleasure of happiness fully .
this is a close up of a flower getting ready to bloom fully .
i saw a chinese lion yesterday .
it was almost as colorful as my umbrella .
i also bought some statues .
i finished the day by visiting fields of pink
and yellow flowers .
a man went to the market and bought a cute stuffed toy for his wife .
while there he bought an umbrella .
he also bought a chinese figurine .
the man then went to buy beautiful flowers for is wife .
he found yellow flowers that were just as beautiful and bought those also .
have you ever wondered what happens to a local amusement park when it gets shut down .
most of the time the rides are just left where they are to gather dust .
the carousel horses are taken down and stored .
they remove the statues in parts and put them <UNK> .
the ferris wheel stands <UNK> over the lonely park remembering its <UNK> days of providing fun and laughter for the
this is an abandoned amusement park .
there is dirt and debris everywhere ,
even on the bumper cars .
it is really spooky .
no one is here accept the cats .
the entrance to the old amusement park .
the rides just looked <UNK> <UNK> . like no one cares .
perhaps someone can come along and bring this back to life .
you wonder how many kids had fun here over the years .
i wish i could ride the ferris wheel . perhaps there is a switch somewhere ?
we took a trip to visit the old fair grounds .
it was a little creepy walking around the abandoned bumper car track .
the child 's horse was left off to the side of a carousel .
this dusty batman <UNK> figure was still attached to the carousel .
wow , this trip was interesting and ended in an appropriate shot of the old ferris wheel in the twilight
we recently traveled to an abandoned carnival .
the bumper cars , long abandoned , have collected dust over time .
this giraffe speaks of an era long past .
batman is as popular today as he was long ago , although he has had a face lift .
one can only imagine the screaming , giggling patrons of this abandoned carnival ride .
art finds many forms .
art <UNK> so many emotions .
art represents <UNK> of beauty .
art can be fierce .
art can be adorable .
everything is painted in this town .
would you know this town was covered in graffiti ?
cute graffiti ? look at these little shoe prints .
intense graffiti ? realistic and impressive .
so much art . so much talent . i loved walking through the streets , admiring the decor by <UNK>
our city is really a lovely place .
even the graffiti is done in good taste .
paintings on the building depicting beautiful people .
and gorgeous statues .
and who could resist the baby penguin named [female] ?
a parking <UNK> is decorated in pink .
the skyline of the city is beautiful against the sky and river .
foot steps of various colors adorn the boardwalk .
some art is seen on the walls .
some different <UNK> art is seen .

the view from up high was amazing .
then we came to some artwork on the ground .
there was many different types of murals on the walls .
we saw so many different artist 's work .
we were excited about our trip to the amusement park .
one of the first things you see getting into the park is the massive ferris wheel .
we went into this weird side show .
here is an odd mask i found in one of the gift shops .
we had an awesome time at the fair .
enjoy now graffiti at the train station .
friends on their way to the fair .
about to get on the ferris wheel .
best friends having fun after the ferris wheel ride .
after the fair the friends had fun playing card games .
[female] hopped on the train to meet her friends at the carnival .
her first stop had to be the organization organization ; it was her favorite ride !
afterwards , she wanted to see a show .
she was so happy to find a great party mask !
the best part of the night , though , was good times with her friends .
a short subway ride to the fair , ca n't wait to get there !
ferris wheels are my favorite ride . i love the view from up there .
we have to go into the strangest show on earth , who could resist .
it was strange but i expected it to be more scary .
a fun day is almost over . back to the subway !
today we took the train into the city .
we hung out at the amusement park .
we saw a freak show .
we even got to try on the performers ' costumes .
we made sure to take lots of group photos .
the <UNK> was ready for entertainment .
the play was ready to start ,
the girls were dressed and ready .
the lights make the building look good .
night time in a city is amazing .
this is an amazing little city
even the mannequins are hot
the town center is all lit up
there is an ambiance of <UNK>
and the coolest lighting you will ever see
i went to see [female] this weekend .
[female] has made many many albums .
afterwards we drove around town .
this is my little gas saving car .
there were very colorful buildings being lit up in lights .
there was nothing like a live performance .
location had always been a favorite .
after a show , she would often window show .
she loved the lights .
it was a nice to stroll along the city streets and reflect on the show , the performers , the
we were headed to see <UNK> <UNK> !
this is the beautiful building where the play will be shown !
she looks so amazing and pretty !
afterwards we checked out the sites of the city !
the city was so amazing and beautiful ! we had fun !
this is a festival that i went to the other day .
there were a lot of floats and interesting things to see .
we met these people who wanted to hang out with us .
we saw these girls that were doing all kinds of weird things .
we took this last picture right before we went home .
we went to an odd park today . maybe it was a circus ?
there were roller coasters and a lot of other rides .
there were even some attractive women in <UNK> outfits .
a lot of people really liked the park .
i lost it at the dunk tanks though . those poor people . i 'm not coming back to this
a large crowd turned out for the location state fair .
games and rides were abundant for kids and adults alike .
some fair goers came dressed up for the festivities .
others came less dressed to soak in the sun .
on this ride you can see the entire fair and the massive amount of people .
everyone came out to watch the parade .
they watched the crazy floats go by ,
and took pictures of the people wearing interesting costumes .
some costumes were less costumes than they were <UNK> .
but a good time was still had by all as they flooded the beach to celebrate the event .
this years fair was a rather odd affair . so many people showed up this time .
there where many odd things going around like this odd looking pig made from paper .
so many people showing off their skin this year . i have to admit that it took me off guard
i had no idea what was going on here , but the ladies looked really nice this year .
i was in a cage ride . at the time i thought it was a good idea to take a
i went to the fair last week .
i ate a lot of snacks .
there were many roller coasters there .
i had a great time .
afterward we left to eat some dinner .
[male] decided ice cream was a good decision . hot summer day .
his sister [female] looked on , and said nothing . she knew .
he continued eating his ice cream , <UNK> , determined .
[female] decided to let it go , go for a ride at the <UNK> , and give her brother [male]
[male] 's girlfriend , who knows organization is <UNK> , looked on , with disapproval .
my friend eating an ice cream cone .
still eating the cone , just from a different view .
here comes a big roller coaster that we will be on next .
here i am waiting to go up on the swings .
time to relax for awhile and go back to the room .
we stopped and got some ice cream at the fair .
we finished that and went to the rides .
we first rode the roller coaster .
then moved on to the large swings .
we had fun for a bit then headed back home .
not another ice cream , she said .
you 're gon na get fat if you do n't watch it she told him .
it 's just an ice cream he said .
okay , okay , hurry up and finish it so we can get on a ride .
so he <UNK> it down and did n't tell her about the brain freeze it gave him .
the bar was littered with souls ready to sing along tonight .
the drinks were flowing and flowing ...
and the band played in the background .
there was n't a gloomy picture in the entire room ...
and , folks danced the night away .
i was on vacation last weekend .
there were a ton of decorations .
everything was beautiful .
the restaurants had a very nice atmosphere .
i really enjoyed it .
we decided to go to a nightclub and listen to some live music .
here 's my lovely drink !
the musicians were amazingly talented and enjoyable to listen to !
i loved the pretty little lamps on all of the tables .
we caught mom and dad enjoying a dance !
the couple decided to go to the bar for their anniversary .
they enjoyed a few drinks together .
the music was very nice that night .
they liked the lighting of the place .
they danced the night away , very much in love with each other .
the people were at the party
and having a drink .
they were listening to music
and they had a romantic night
kissing each other .
visiting aztec in location with the whole family .
the <UNK> ruins . they said it has n't been touched but i can tell they remodeled it .
some of the old buildings that the <UNK> used to live in .
some bananas in our room . still waiting for them to ripe .
downtown . not very <UNK> like .
the historic stone building architecture is simply amazing .
the pyramid was picturesque with the stairs and trees .
the waterway underneath the rocks was quite amazing .
the historic blue round building is a masterpiece .
the historic building is beautiful still to this date .
i could tell the age of the building just by looking .
i could n't believe i was in front of a pyramid .
but it seemed like i had to climb a lot to get anywhere .
the fruits and things they had growing surprised me .
i hope i 'll get to see more places with just as much history .
old cities tell stories .
their stories may sometimes be very mysterious ,
but extraordinary either way .
old cities remind us how life might have been back then
and how far we 've come . it is always good to remember our progress as a people .
the buildings were old
and so was the pyramid
in the old city .
there were bananas
sold at the local store .
getting ready to ride the tallest ride in town !
here is a picture from the very top !
up this high you get a great picture of the bay .
[male] is calm and relaxed .
we are so high ! !
watching the group we could n't have been more proud .
the flag waved beautifully as they stood .
they were so orderly .
the greeting was special .
she gave a great speech .
the ferris wheel offers folks a chance to see a new vantage .
some models are on the table .
the people look like little bugs from such a high altitude .
he looks a bit concerned over being so high in the air .
the other man is somewhat relaxed .
we rode the ferris wheel .
it took us really high up in the air .
we got to see all the boats in the water .
it was so much fun .
then we saw the buildings in the city from up high .
the ferris wheel was big
and there was a map
of the big city .
the man was happy
as they were riding .
i love the roller coaster .
and the beach .
even if i ca n't swim .
i went on the water anyhow .
then i saw a tower .
a family went to the beach and walked along the boardwalk .
they played boardwalk games .
they rode on the roller coasters .
there were tons of seagulls on the beach when they got there .
a lot of people were swimming because the weather was so nice .
i came for the <UNK> . i could ride them all day long .
my wife wanted time at the beach . i can only take so much of that .
beaches with no swimming signs and lots of people in the water do not make much sense .
i like the view <UNK> looking back at the city .
this is a really cool ride . you can see for miles and miles !
beaches can be fun !
there is always a lot of fun to be had in the sand .
even when swimming is n't <UNK> due to danger ,
it is always nice to relax and soak up the sun .
if you are in to thrill , this beach has rides to suit your needs .
the boardwalk was surprisingly empty when they arrived .
there were some odd <UNK> along the street .
the classic rollercoaster were already up and running .
the seagulls were running the beach . hopefully you brought some <UNK> to keep them at bay .
it was obvious that not a single soul here , had read this sign .
we were so excited about the natural history <UNK> .
we got to see all the dinosaur skeletons .
then we looked at the polar bear .
one of the exhibits showed us how the earth looked millions of years ago .
we even got to see a real space shuttle .
after the fair we went to the museum .
there were a ton of skeletons there .
i had a great time there .
there were some polar bears too .
there was also a nature exhibit .
natural world museums give us the chance to see life that we would n't normally get to see .
this museum shows us what different creatures bones structures were like .
some animals were massive . it 's hard to imagine how big this creature was when it was alive .
some creatures still exist , yet sometimes we forget how big they are .
museums are very educational and fun to visit .
i went to a museum yesterday .
there were displays of massive creatures .
i ca n't imagine swimming with this creature .
this polar bear looked pretty tough .
there was even a garden with live animals in it .
the kids went to the zoo .
it also was a museum .
there were all kinds of exhibits about far away animals .
the exotic birds were a favorite .
the building was very tall .
aliens were attacking earth today .
everybody was looking in the air scared at all of the aliens
the aliens kept attacking earth <UNK> everything in sight .
we tried to destroy the aliens using fireworks ! finally fighting back !
unfortunately it did nothing . earth was destroyed .
the street is filling up with people to see the show .
the first firework bust in the sky as we all watch .
people are starting to set off their own fireworks and crackers .
shooting upwards these ones make a loud noise !
the real fireworks are blowing up <UNK> in the sky above us .
the street was crowded with people .
we walked in a bright strip .
fireworks began to <UNK> nearby .
many men and women joined in .
fireworks in the city was a marvelous sight .
new years again . i always get excited when i see the lights and explosions .
here is tom trying to take pictures of people . every year i try to tell him it is about
so much smoke from the explosions . we hear the fire trucks in the distance , but paid then no
some the the fireworks did not even go higher than the buildings around us .
on of the rockets fell down and flew into this building . we had such a blast till the cops
starting the fire work show .
setting up and taking pictures of the show .
there were fireworks debris on the floor everywhere .
the show started above our head .
at the end there were smoke and everyone went home .
the man was giving a speech for the crowd that lovely day .
the crowd was gathered around the speaker listening intently .
a man is seen on a bike next to the crowd and helicopter .
the man is waving good bye as he prepares to exit .
the man is preparing to get into the helicopter to his destination .
[male] was speaking to the people .
they were ready for change .
the city needed to change or it would die .
they knew how important this was , because they loved the city .
after his speech , his people greeted him .
the candidate gave a speech .
there was a small crowd there to hear him .
some came by bike .
he waved to the crowd .
then he left on a helicopter .
the speaker stood high above the crowd to be heard .
the crowd turned and listened with interest .
some of those gathered had traveled there by bicycle .
the speaker waved to the crowd before departing .
a helicopter was waiting to take him to the next location .
there was a rally event today at the park .
many people attended .
some even showed up on bicycles .
there was a large crowd .
there was even a helicopter .
the bakery had a selection of pastries .
some items were shaped into figures .
there 's always freshly baked items for sale daily .
the <UNK> come in early every morning .

i decided to hike in another direction , and that is how i found this small creek .
i followed it to this beach , and i spent the rest of my day there . it was sad
this small town is just a small portion of the surrounding area .
the land is untouched by civilization .
it is big and vast
and full of life . the water is crystal clear
and makes its way all the way out to the ocean . it is a unique an charming little place
this weekend we went to the location location location .
we pass through many hills on our walk .
this mountain formation was so beautiful and made me realize how peaceful and serene nature is .
the river flowed forever .
at the end of the day we finally reached the end of the trail and there was a beach .
we parked just out front of the station .
it was not too long before we saw the train approaching under the bridge .
to the left of the station there was a sea , just beyond the village .
we took a stroll on the beach so that i could show dad the boating area .
he was surprised that it was free to use any boat that we wanted .
last week , i went down to the harbor .
in the beginning of the day , not a soul was out .
then , slowly , the small boats came in to sell their fish .
just as fast as they came , they started to leave .
as the tide went out , so did the boats .
we decided to take a day trip out to the lake .
we rode a train to get there .
when stepped out , we got a nice view of the <UNK> peaks .
we decided to rent out a boat .
after sailing for a while , we landed ashore .
we drove to the park and ride to take the train to the shore .
the train was on time , as usual .
the shore was peaceful , and the mountains were still <UNK> .
several boats were in the water , that was surprising in the cool air .
more boats were <UNK> at the shore , waiting there for their owners to take them back out to the
we parked the car at the station and waited for the train .
the train was right on time .
here was our view from the train window .
we arrived at the fishing village at noon time .
i was looking forward to some freshly caught seafood for lunch .
the peaked building was seen overlooking the ocean .
the beautiful building had amazing architecture .
the statue stood in front of the yellow historic building .
the two man pose for a picture on that beautiful day .
the lights lit up a night showing the location is the place to be .
we had a great time on our mexican vacation .
lots of fun going on by the ocean .
lots of cool buildings there as well .
the sunset was beautiful .
now it is time to party .
our visit to the coast was a huge success . we had great weather .
many people come here to take advantage of the <UNK> for kite flying .
the old church was certainly a site to behold with the ocean as a backdrop .
the clouds in the night sky made us feel small .
lighted signs at night gave the place an air of festivity .
in <UNK> , what a beautiful country with beautiful scenery .
headed to eat in a nice restaurant .
this restaurant is great , the best lobster in town .
here we are waiting to eat .

here 's a sculpture that we saw while in the main part of the city .
here 's me and my friend soaking up the sun during lunch .
here 's a little bar we went to during the evening . we had a great time !
it was the perfect time of year for hot cocoa .
the lake had frozen up weeks ago .
the snow was a few feet deep .
and frost covered my hair almost immediately after i stepped outside .
as the sunset , the cold air dropped below zero .
we had a lot of snow during the holidays .
our whole city was covered in a thick blanket of snow .
even the park had the benches covered , there was nothing visible at all .
we had to wear thick coats just to keep warm .
it made the sunset look spectacular when it reflected on the snow .
the house was lit up for christmas .
the family awoke early in the morning to beautiful snow .
everything was covered in a blanket of snow .
they all went outside to play and explore .
at the end of the day they all cuddled up , cozy in the cabin
a couple spent a day and night in a snowy cabin getaway .
they rose early in the morning to watch the sun come up .
as it did , they found a nearby bench that demonstrated the <UNK> , quite calm of the morning .
they noticed that frost had <UNK> from the moisture on the woman 's hair and <UNK> .
as they watched the sun set again , they marveled at how wonderful their day had been .
here 's something i found before we set off on our journey tonight . very pretty lights .
the morning sunrise !
so much snow , i want to take a break .
making my way downtown .
the end of our venture , ending with a sunset . perfect .
the cape coast is going downhill after the storms .
lots of damage to property in the storms <UNK>

much work is needed to be done to get things back to normal .
i would love to see this beautiful area back to life .
a storm came rolling in .
the tide and wind caused great damage along the shore .
the houses sustained much damage .
it made vacant spaces much harder to fill .
the community put out signs to raise awareness on how to show support in order to rebuild what was lost
me and my group are very involved with the `` save the location location '' movement .
we went on a day to take pictures of damaged buildings and coast line like this .
this wall is <UNK> and may fall apart if people such as my group do not <UNK> .
here is another example of some of the <UNK> we faced on our trip .
it is possible to transform places like this back to glory . we just need to keep coming back and
we volunteered to clean the beach and town after the hurricane .
there was debris all over .
some of the homes had holes and pieces ripped out from the strong winds .

today was rather chilly but i rode my bike to the beach anyways .
i 'm getting closer .

the woman decided to go for a bike ride along the beach .
the photographer set up for an action shot , with the beach and waves in the background .
the photographer then caught the woman racing toward him .
during the ride , they snapped photos of the water and the sand .
at the end of the ride , she posed for a picture . she had a great time on the
riding bikes next to the ocean was how [female] stayed in shape .
the view was amazing so it helped to clear her mind .
the sound of the waves crashing against the sand kept her focused on <UNK> .
[female] stopped for a bit at her 1 mile point .
when she would reach the beach house 5 miles away from her apartment she would turn around and go home
i took a bike ride along the beach .
then i noticed no one else was there .
after that i stopped to watch the water .
i had to stop and take a break from riding the bike .
at the end of my trip i came across some buildings along the water .
we traveled by car to the bay .
off in the distance , we spotted a lighthouse .
up close , the lighthouse was huge .
we were able to go up in the lighthouse and the view was awesome .
there were many rocks jutting up from the water .

this is our <UNK> as we left .
there was nothing but sand for quite some time .
eventually we ran across a stone ridge .
believe it or not , there were green plants growing there .
when we all arrived , we felt ready to cross the hot <UNK> .
but we were smart and took the time to look around for a bit before we started .
it looked like we <UNK> the only ones here , as we saw an pack animal closer to the cliffs
they looked so big and the space so narrow once we got closer !
we kept going , finally arriving at the spot we would be going through .

it hardly had anyone living in it but we did see a child playing by the beach as we arrived
the resort we had booked was beautiful and did n't <UNK> with the local area .
the beaches were almost deserted , so we got to spend a lot of relaxing time exploring it .
as the sunset , we knew that this was going to be a highlight of our trip .

that night , we watched the fireworks .
it was one of the best 4th of july we 've ever had .
the group of friends stayed in a funky cabin for spring break . art deco style figurines decorated the exterior
the red figurine had a solemn facial expression .
but the friends had a great time playing with silly toys .

the art was interesting
along the building .

with a balloon
at the beach .

before a plane is ready to go .
the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> have a lot of work to do . they line up their <UNK> vehicles .
they line up the <UNK> carts .
putting enormous crates of <UNK> into a plane 's cargo hold requires perfect <UNK> . the cargo <UNK> can do
the plane leaves right on time . the passengers on board did even notice the few minutes it took for
everything at the airport looked so busy that it made me even more nervous about my flight .
after takeoff , i felt better once i looked out my window and saw the beautiful view .
after landing , the sky was less attractive , a dreary gray having taken over .
things looked busy here too , but it did n't worry as much this time .
once outside the plane , it looked even less attractive , but it was the country i was excited for
we took a trip in an airplane .
the airplane got so high in the air .
then we landed to our destination .

we looked at the <UNK> that grew on the dunes .
some of them were very dry looking .
others , however , were very lush and green .
my class learned a lot about the beach that day .
i went on vacation and visited an <UNK> town in location .
the place was quiet , as most people had left it .

we rode our atv to the mountain top ...
and , suddenly , we were back on the beach and viewing a wondering opening .
i asked my husband to take a picture ; however , he preferred to stand behind the camera .
we then moved back to the mountain and saw a beautiful <UNK>
the inlet showed the strong power of the water moving in from the ocean . we took our picture and
this area is filled with nature 's beauty , like the clean sand and blue ocean water .
the rocks carved by the waves are stunning to look at .
the naturally formed arched rock feature is especially stunning to look at .
the rock formation perfectly frames the ocean waves .
such a beautiful beach is <UNK> contrasted by the <UNK> road nearby .

this building is very tall . look at the tiny windows though ! how did anyone get any air ?
this is a photo of inside of the building . it was very interesting and i learned a lot of

it was a beautiful place with <UNK> lawns .
the mansion itself was modeled after a castle .

in fact , it was a previous prince that <UNK> the ruins . he loved the greek ruins when he
we approached the building in the distance .
it had a giant course in front of it .
then we could see the castle in the distance .
even from that distance it was amazing .
we walked near old ruins and saw the sights on the way back .
the columns were very nice looking
under the pretty sky .
the castle was huge
and was between trees
there were pillars everywhere .

they never knew where the paths would lead them .
they finally met the waters edge .
it looked like it stretched on so far in the distance .
deep in the caves you could still see the snow .
the two men rode the bus in a respectable manner .
the snow was just beginning to melt outside .
beyond the shore was a lovely ocean .

our travels brought us to an interesting looking rock structure .
on closer look , it was a castle .
my sister just just a little taller than the earth wall .
there were sheep grazing nearby .
the sheep 's water source was clear , and probably the reason the castle was build here .
there was a tall monument on a hill .
it was made of large stones .
a man walked along the grass and looked at it .
some sheep walked nearby in a field .
behind the sheep there was a large body of water .

when the blue sky finally came out we took a great picture of ourselves .
we were hiking through the plains the other day .
while hiking through the plains we came upon a ridge .
after we crossed the ridge we were shocked to find a beach on the other side .
from the beach we spotted a huge rock jutting out of the water .
we walked closer to the rock and was surprised at how big it really was up close .

i walked a little closer and found people enjoying some kind of festival .
ahh the beach is a wonderful place ,
except when it 's filled with tourists .
well , it 's still pretty nice , but it 's better when it 's empty .
however , with tourists , come new and cool beach side businesses
which make the beach an even better place to be during the summer .
we took a trip down to the lake .

this garden was an attractive sight .
a few miles away from the vacation spot there was a canyon people liked to visit .

i had a great view of the ocean and i could see many things .
the island was open and was surrounded by very blue waters .
the pink flowers were very bold and fresh in this area .

our beach vacation is at this beautiful waterfront resort .
we took walks on the sandy cliffs of the beach .
we really enjoyed the outdoor mall with <UNK> restaurant seating and live music .

we spent some time walking along an ocean facing cliff .
we also spent some time in the city . we stopped to watch a trio perform .
i was happy to see how much music there was in the city . at one point , during lunch
moved by the music , my boyfriend wanted to visit the cliffs once more to witness nature 's music ,
we first went at the shores to get a closer look at the incredible view of the city .
we can see the apartment we rented for the week . it has a great view .
i took this pictures of the <UNK> . they enjoying the light breeze of the afternoon .
i asked the local about this log , apparently it came from a old <UNK> boat that <UNK> here .
this is where we sat and admired the vast location sea .
an <UNK> person decided to head to the water to quiet their mind .
as they strolled along the sandy beach , they stumbled across this family of geese .
after being chased away by the <UNK> geese for getting too close , they moved away from the beach and
they also found a few cool <UNK> to admire . this fish was one of their favorites .
before leaving they found this inspirational quote that put things in perspective .
i decided to quit my job and move to an island , for a big change of pace .
the island was almost deserted . the geese were my only friends .
in solitude , i had time to contemplate the small things in life .
i thought a lot about myself , and the direction in which i had been headed , and where i
in unlikely places , i found words of wisdom , and i continued on my journey .
the ocean created a beautiful view from the coast .
there were plenty of animals around .
there was also many different flowers .
the signs were very unique .
we made sure to read every sign .
the family took a vacation at the beach .
there were tall buildings by the water .
there were ducks sitting in the sand .
a long branch was sticking out from the rocks .
the landscape was beautiful and there were lots of trees .
my wife and i spent 4th of july at the beach .
my brother brought over some super hot sauce .
after dinner we went down to the beach .
we thought lighting fireworks by the water was the <UNK> way to do it .
it made for some interesting pictures .
my friends and i went to the beach for a day of fun .
my dog wanted to explore and greet everyone !
we did some playing around as the day wore on .
someone brought sparklers , and we drew pictures in the air .
once it was dark we all headed home . it was a nice day .
my boyfriend and i had a get together with some friends last weekend .
my best friend and her boyfriend came to the restaurant .
it was near a beach , so after we finished eating we took a stroll .
someone brought some fireworks .
we shot them off til the restaurant staff told us to stop .
the happy couple were throwing an independence day party .

the kids also played in the sand
my family is a bit strange in some ways but one thing we all like to do if fish and
there are lots of different ways to catch crab and normally i would not do it this <UNK> way but
the <UNK> method does and did work and as you can see we caught some crabs to eat .
here is a better photograph of the bucket full of crabs and another creature or two if i remember right
we all got tired and people started falling to sleep so we headed back home knowing that we would be
everyone is gathered at the water to go crab fishing .
this man thinks he has a great line for catching crabs .
looks like someone got one .

we started by making a sand castle at the beach .
we got buckets and got to work .
we then did a little fishing at the docks .

the water was beautiful .
the beach was rocks , not sand .
the birds there were huge .
my wife found an old fireplace and thought it was a shrine .
i love our vacation photos
the ocean and views were amazing
then we entered the <UNK> to see the bird sanctuary .
the birds were <UNK> on the rocks as always
i tried to be funny getting my photo taken here
[female] visited the location location location on a quest to see seals .
she looked for seals in the ocean waters .
she looked for seals on the <UNK> covered beach .
she pulled out her binoculars and looked for seals resting on rocks half <UNK> in the water .
[female] then realized that her real quest was to find herself and finished the day by <UNK> .
ah the seal <UNK> . this is where they said we could find the <UNK> .
well , i 'm not seeing any seals here . are you sure we 're in the right place ?
this beach is murder on my <UNK> . no wonder there are n't any seals here , it 's all
`` i think they 're looking for the <UNK> '' . `` hey , she 's over there '' .
at last , there she is . excuse me , we 've been looking for you miss <UNK> . can
the organization organization organization is a wonderful place to visit .
seals can be seen in the choppy waters .
small rocks of various sizes cover the <UNK> .
larger rocks provide a place for seals and birds to rest .
a stone monument there makes a great place to take pictures !
my first plane ride and i had to pick a small plane .
the pilot tells me it is very safe but i 'm not convinced .
we are ready for take off and all i can do is shut my eyes .
[male] finally got me to open my eyes and the view was amazing .
the flight turned out fine but i was so happy to get my feet back on solid ground .
my wife wanted something special for vacation .
after she got off work , i picked her up and took her to the airport .
i had <UNK> a small airplane .
this was our destination .
once there we rented a boat and spent the weekend on the water .
[female] was so excited to get her first private airplane ride .
the pilot looked ready for takeoff .
once we were in the air , the view of the landscape was breathtaking .
we flew over the coastal waters on final approach .
we all gathered around for a picture after the plane ride .
she smiled <UNK> , trying not to show that she was nervous about flying in the small plane with a
the pilot grinned . he was n't the least bit worried about passing his test . he assured everyone that
the flight instructor gave small helpful hints , but mostly let his <UNK> figure things out on his own .
the plane glided smoothly over the lake . everything was going as planned .
the group smiled for the camera , and readied themselves for their own test flight .
i arrived at the airport and i am feeling so excited !
here we are with the pilot before we get in the plane for our trip .
looking out towards our destination as we are flying .
after arriving at the lake we look around at the scene .
my new husband and i are relaxing on the boat .
my friend and i rented a boat for the weekend .
we looked out on the lake and saw how beautiful and calm it was as we went out .
my friend wanted to get a good photo of himself on the dock before it got dark .
the sunset made for beautiful oranges and it was a lovely day .
as the sun <UNK> lower in the sky , i reflected on how much fun it was being with my
we enjoyed a summer vacation where we traveled to a spanish island .
on the island , we rode bikes to sight see .
we came across this fisherman who was getting ready to <UNK> .
the beautiful , local beaches stretched for miles .
our favorite part of the trip was watching the sun set on the water every evening .
this fisherman is in his boat .
he loves being at sea .
the sea is where he makes his living .
watching the sunset was calming for him .
he knew he would be back here again tomorrow .
we are about to take out the boat and go fishing .
it is a beautiful day to go fishing .
i just got back from fishing , we caught a lot of fish today .
we just finished eating fish that we had caught today .
the sky looks beautiful tonight , we had a great day .
the evening in the waters just beginning to sail <UNK> .
when the water is still it 's more relaxing .
just sitting on the dock and imagining how great it is .
when the sun has set all the way just beyond the <UNK> it ; s like a bold bright light
a picture perfect as if you can walk on waters .
our family got together for an amazing vacation to see the ocean .
the closer we got to the beach , i could smell the salt water on my taste buds .
i could see the beach getting closer and i became very anxious .
the beach extended as far as the eye could see .
when we got closer to our beach spot , i could see surfers out in the water looking for the
we decided to drive to the beach .
from the car we could see hills of green pasture .
finally we reached a cliff .
we could see views of the beach on either side .
we decided to walk down to the beach to wade in the water .

the scenery was rather dull along the way , but when we get to the beach , it 'll be

we saw a nice beach and decided to explore it .
we started walking up from one end .
and finished off at the other side .
we took one last look and headed back to the car .
this church has old viking statues .
this coffin was made by vikings 1000 years ago .
the church still has services today .
the old building was around 500 years old .
this viking ship was in the basement museum of the church .
we went to the carnival together , it was a lot of fun .
many people were dressed up in costume and were having a good time .
some people had crazy outfits , they were really entertaining .
we also went on a few of the rides , they were really cool !
we ended our day with a visit to the beach , even though it was a big crowded .
on a recent trip out of the country , i viewed an ancient leader of a country <UNK> in his
the ends of the <UNK> were <UNK> hand card .
on the other side of the <UNK> was a small chapel where people can silently pray .
then we went to a local museum where we explored ancient artifacts .
among the ancient artifacts was a boat that was hand crafted and used to do island to island fishing .
this is a tomb of a viking general .
the skull and the crown with the wings are very symbolic .
the art has been beautifully preserved .
the outside of the historic landmark is a sight to see .
these are the old ship they used such an epic time in history .
i love to visit the cathedral behind my house .
the cathedral contains some sort of box that i 'm told is empty , but i remain very curious .
<UNK> , the cathedral burned to the ground last weekend .
one of the only things that survived the fire is this boat .
now , instead of visiting the cathedral , i spend my quiet times on a park bench .
two penguins were sitting in the bushes .
we admired the view of the ocean .
there were many penguins on the beach .
the penguins looked cool near the waves .
my friend wore her sun hat near the penguins .
these two penguins are hiding .
this one wanted to go for a walk .
here is all his friends and family on the beach .
we laughed when we saw this penguin trying to wake his friend up .
my girlfriend was so happy to see the penguins .
we found some beautiful penguins on our trip to location location .
some let us get right up close to them .
the penguins would tend to hang out in groups .
a few penguins separated from the crowd .
my sister could n't resist a picture with the little <UNK> , but did n't want to scare them so
the little penguins were taking a break from the sun !
we loved our view of the ocean !
the penguins were having fun on the beach !
there were so many penguins !

we even fed the hungry seagulls .
this is a picture of a telephone pole .
this is a drawing of a girl .
this is a picture of a sign for the area .
this sign says `` <UNK> '' on the ground .
the letter on the ground is `` <UNK> '' .
you could n't miss the hotel due to the large letters on the building .
it was located off of the main highway .
a <UNK> had escaped from prison with his hands till <UNK> together .
but the people on the beach were completely unaware of this news .
they were too busy enjoying the sounds of nature and birds singing .
the hotel is high up
above the traffic
and near the artwork .
the people walk along the shore
and see birds .
decided to walk along the beach and see what i can find .
i build a sandcastle of of dirt and wood just for fun .

we built towers out of stones that we found along the shore .
the weather was perfect outside .

a man and a boy visited a <UNK> town .
the man and his son had already made it to the beach by around noon .
the boy was very eager to give body boarding a try .
the boy stayed on the body board ( in part because the waves were very small ) .
the man and his son stayed at the beach until sunset .
the ocean side town was mostly a fishing town .

when we arrived at the beach the parking lot was full .
we waited in line to grab a bite to eat .
we took off our shoes and walked on the sand .
then we headed towards the waves to splash around .
we walked on the beach until we reached some rocks .
i drove out to the beach last weekend .
i brought all my beach gear with me .
there were some large boulders on the beach .
i resort was nearby .
i had a great time .
it was my first time seeing mountains along the ocean .
we took a few silly shots before our walk .
the coastline here was very rocky but gorgeous .
our hotel was expensive but well worth it .
we plan to make this an annual trip .
i took a beach trip last week to a remote town in location .
the beach was completely full of people .
however , i was a little disappointed because the ocean water was quite rocky .
the accommodations were n't particularly special either .
still , it gave me comfort to watch the sunset from the ocean every evening .
my father took me out one day to play in the winter wonderland .
i enjoyed running around in the fresh snow .
dad pulled me around on a sled since there were no hills near us .
i laid down and worked on a snow angel .
and there it will stay till the next heavy snow falls .
in the winter , the town where i grew up was a place of wide snow covered roads and friendly
how well i remember the rides on my little sled pulled by mom on brilliant days .
with delight i 'd roll in the icy cold <UNK> making snow angels .
then after a day of play in the cold fields , mom and i would <UNK> back to town .
back in our warm house , mom would make hot chocolate with marshmallows to warm our weary , happy souls
the kids had the day off school for snow , and we decided to make the most of it .
we bundled them up from head to toe .
first , we went sledding . it took us a while to find a good spot though .
next , they made snow angels .
they were so happy with the end result . they decided snow days were the best days ever .
it was a snowy day , so we decided to go for a walk to a big open field .
once we were in the field , i pulled my daughter on a sled since the ground was completely flat
we decided sledding was n't the best idea , so we made snow angels in the snow .
we started getting cold , so we walked back to our house .
we made it after a long walk , and then we went inside and had hot chocolate , and then
the day was cold but the snow was lovely !
this little guy clearly enjoyed himself .
it was a lot of fun sledding about .
and everyone loves making snow angels .
this one turned out really well !
our overseas trip was amazing . this was the skyline when flying into the airport .

we also went to the beach , here are we going for our day trip .
the next day we went on a big boat ride in the harbor .
and at the end we went shopping in a multi level mall , it was amazing !
[female] is bored with her life , she wants to explore new places all by herself .
she views the city and realizes she needs to get away and go away someplace different .
the next morning she catches a bus that takes her out of the city .
the bus drops her off at a port where she gets on a boat which will sail away .
the boat takes her to the beach , which she feels <UNK> her soul . she loves her new surroundings
the night sky was lit up .
tickets for the lounge were sold out .

we recently traveled along a vast river in a jungle .
there were people on boats going up and down the river .
we stopped for lunch at a restaurant on the river .
after lunch , we watched children playing at the base of this large tree .
we also saw many wild creatures along the way .

the view of the river from the <UNK> was relaxing .
the travelers were amazed at this ancient tree .
a little crab stops to pose for a picture .
the lake was lined with <UNK> structures .

if you needed a place to relax the deck served that purpose well .
and the tree served as a great conversation piece with its <UNK> branches .
the large spider interrupted her thoughts as she yelled in fear .
the bridge was falling in
but the boats could get through .
they got to the resort
with the large tree
and the interesting animals .
every time he got in the car he was worried that they may be headed for the vet .
his human parked the car and they crossed the street .
he could smell the water as soon as they made it to the other side .
they played on the sand all day long .
at the end both the dog and his human were exhausted after all the fun .
our dog loves our <UNK> .
he loved the walk on the beach .
this part was a bit treacherous for him , but he <UNK> .
he enjoyed taking a break here .

one lone walker was enjoying the day like we were .
puppy got a little excited about chasing birds , so i had to hold him for a while while he
the dog was enjoying his time of solitude .
and so was his master on the beach .
it seemed as if the place was completely isolated .
eventually the dog and his master reunited and relaxed .
it was a beautiful place of serenity .
the dog was licking its lips
when it saw the sign
near the beach .
the water was calm
and the dog looked out into the water .
i took a short walk on the nature trail to the beach .
there were a lot of huge trees along the way .
some of them were over 100 feet tall .
it was cloudy when we got to the beach .
but after about half an hour the skies cleared up !
we went for a hike on a nature trail .
it was a cloudy , grey day .
there were many interesting rock formations along the coast .
we made sure to <UNK> of our trash properly .
the sun came out just as we finished our walk .
my hike through the woods to the beach was exciting
there was one big tree that really caught my eye .
looking up , i saw the branches spread so i could hardly see the sky .
at first when i got to the beach the sky was gray and cloudy .
later the sun came out and the colors of the sky , land , and sea were beautiful !

the sea lion mom is checking out her new baby .
the new baby seems strong and healthy .
the sea gulls come along to help clean up the mess so the new baby can enjoy its new life
this mother seal is giving birth .
she will push until the baby is delivered .
once out the baby will lay there and get its strength up until it can move about .

in no time flat the baby is up and ready to go .
the seals were laying around
on the beach .
they looked at each other
and did not know what to think .

the meal really hit the spot . dessert sounded so amazing that i decided not to share .
our family vacation this year was to location , location .
we saw spectacular sunsets each evening .
lounging under beach umbrellas every afternoon is something i could get used to !
there were so many restaurants to try .
the fresh seafood is simply amazing and i tried something new - <UNK> greens !
i visited the sea one weekend and found a bunch of shells .
the sun was setting over the water and was absolutely gorgeous .
in town , i found a large multicolored tent set up .
i ate at a place called captain [male] 's , which served seafood .
the seafood came with sides and was delicious !
i 'm so glad my husband suggested the beach this weekend .
our first night was spent strolling the shore .
we were the first to open our umbrella on the beach the following morning .
seafood is a must on a beach getaway .
our meal so fresh , the fish was straight off the boat . the weekend ended too quickly .
when mount <UNK> erupted the people had no chance of survival .
fathers tried to shield their <UNK> .
mothers picked up their children and ran .
whole families tried to out run the red hot lava and ash .
but it was too late ! they and the city were gone .
this is some amazing art work .
the person who created this sculpture is very creative .
interesting use of clay and general design .
it looks like these people are flying .
this reminded me of me and my mom holding me tight .
there were many spooky sculptures on display .
this one depicts a baby crying in its mother 's arms .
other kids are also scared .
it looks like they 're screaming .
this child looks like it 's crying .
i tipped the statue on accident .
i looked at it closely to see if it was broken .
it was not broken so i stood up .
i glanced at it to make sure it looked right .
the hand seemed to be <UNK> .
the statues outside where intense .
they where dark and kind of creepy .
some of women holding children .
usually , while screaming and crying .
the last one we saw was simply an arm , but it said so much .
i went to the beach last weekend .
it was beautiful there .
i had a great time .
there were some beautiful plains nearby as well .
i went down to the dock afterward .
the grounds did n't appear as cold during daylight .
entering the park , we realized what a beautiful place this was .
crossing the bridge over the hot springs in the cold weather was incredible .
so many people enjoyed themselves in the springs .
we loved our time at the resort .
the landscape offered an escape
not a soul around these parts
the fog came in early over the bridge
and the animals were roaming the ice
it was a very cold day indeed
it was a very cold day out and the clouds were heavy .
there were people in the water which was strange .
the water was so nice and it felt great on the people 's bodies .
to the north , the land was very dry and rough .
these people were glad they lived in the opposite direction .
we began our trip in an ordinary looking part of the country .
soon we were walking along a winding path surrounded by walls of rock .
we knew we were at our destination when we had to cross a bridge that was <UNK> over crystal blue
we noticed others were already enjoying their time in the warm water .
besides enjoying the warm water , we had a wonderful view of the mountain .
outside of the facility <UNK> plants were everywhere .
beautiful statues depicted children playing in a pond .
there was even a bronze statue that was as tall as the buildings .
inside there were works from nearby artists .
some of the art held a special and <UNK> message .
we walked along the outdoor mall and saw this cute fountain .
next to it was this statute that was a cross between location and <UNK> .
we then took a stroll down to the beach .
we watched the tide come in as the sun started to set .
my husband enjoyed watching the water and the sunset .
they dropped us in an immaculate garden . filled with <UNK> statues ...
like the <UNK> of the camp , a strong man with a spear .
we then walked to the beach and saw the gorgeous <UNK>
and , the first concrete pier i had ever seen .
that is where i took my final photo of the trip .
i got some <UNK> <UNK> last week .
it is very good for you .
i also bought a statue .
and this to hang on my wall .
i had a great time shopping .
the baby cactus are many in the field
a circle of love in sculptures is great in town view
we all wonder when we visit each having our own views of the statue in standing
the nice figurines showing family or a mother 's love for child
being able to put your ideas on a figurine is an option of your choice
we went on a vacation to location to explore the country .
we found a lot of nice people and interesting sights .
the country overall was fairly poor and we felt bad at times .
the rivers were wild and mostly used for fishing .
many people make their living fishing
my friends and i decided to go canoeing .
it was a bit of a struggle to get the canoe in the water .
while we were in the water , we came across a goose .
after we were done in the canoe , we laid out on the beach to tan .
just as we were leaving , a huge group of people canoeing came .
the boats all lay on the shore in the morning hours .
one boy decided to see if the boat was any fun to use .
on the opposite side of the lake , there was a bird enjoying the crisp , summer day .
people were on the beach having a good time with the water .
later on that day , people gathered in the boats and set sail .
i went to the beach last week .
there were some boats there .
i helped them build some more boats .
it took a long time .
i had a great time there .
the boat looked very inviting from a distance .
though it was a lot of work to get ready .
saw this lovely bird out on the water .
and some <UNK> having fun .
the day was crowded with many others enjoying the fun day .
i was in the mood for a hike , so i decided to go to the beach .
i hiked along the shoreline around sunset .
it was very calming , and i felt <UNK> .
i guess a friend of mine had the same idea , we continued the hike together .
we walked until dusk and then <UNK> ways .
a day at the beach with me and my wife .
the sand was so smooth ; it looked amazing .
that 's my wife taking <UNK> pictures of the sunset .
i loved being with her on these lovely days .
the sunset picture she took . i love being in love .
today , we got up early to watch the sunrise .
it was a beautiful view , with the waves crashing on the beach below .
here , the sun is up a bit higher , so lovely .
we made sure to get lots of good pictures !
the sun is mostly up now , what a great start to the day !
we had hiked for miles and miles ...
we finally reached the point of no <UNK>
the water was flowing over the rocks ...
and , the wind was blowing wildly ...
we decided we better hurry , because the rain appeared to be coming .
we finally arrived at the coast .
the beaches are more rocky than i imagined .
my dad walking down the beach .
we set up the camera take the best pictures .
this is a beautiful sunset we captured .
we were excited when we saw our old-fashioned hotel for our weekend at the beach .
we were excited to see the outdoor market and shops .
there was a shop that sold all kinds of <UNK> <UNK> .
one shop displayed all kinds of brightly colored <UNK> .
when the day was over we were so tired and happy to see our lovely room .
[female] was ready for the trip to the beach .
he jumped in his luxury car .
he made it to his luxury hotel .
and he looked out his luxury window .
however , the beach he planned to go to , was not luxurious at all .
i went down to the pier last week to buy a new car .
it was pretty expensive .
my hotel was also pretty expensive .
it was in downtown .
we were n't allowed to swim at the beach today .
we decided to have a beach <UNK> .

we visited a soap shop upon my mom 's request .
everything was so beautiful
and out hotel room was very inviting
the motel was vast .
guests went shopping often .

after a long day of shopping guest could look forward to relaxing in their rooms .
our family recently went to the beach for vacation .
we started the mornings with homemade , <UNK> <UNK> . yum !
then we went down to the beach and played some games ,
followed by a hike along a nature trail .
afterward , we cooled off by wading in the sea .
another great field trip to the beach .
the students were n't super excited at first , but we knew they would be soon .
walking carefully into the tide pools , watching for sharp shells or living creatures .
one student found something just under the surface .
observing more carefully to find out exactly what 's hiding under the sand .
we were all at the beach getting ready for a lovely day of fun !
first , we made beautiful heart shaped <UNK> .
[male] threw a rock into the water because he was so hungry for <UNK> .

they picked up small objects they found .
i brought my roommate along to hike with us .
along the trail , we found this lovely red flower .
in the cool water , i told my friend to take a picture of their feet .
we used a bridge to get closer to the train that would take us home .
when we found the tracks , we waited until the trail came near .
josh told me he saw a dead body and wanted to show me .
i got cold feet , but josh insisted i follow him .
he took me to some strange places . how far away was this body ?
he looked through these cracks to see if anyone was looking . but why ?
we kept going down this track . he said `` we will see the body soon . '' funny i
my friend and i took a short road trip this weekend to see the scenery .
we found trees that had begun to change color and gorgeous leaves that had fallen .
i waded into a shallow stream and perched on a rock .
we saw a railroad bridge over a river .
we decided to follow the railroad for a few minutes , but turned back .
[male] loved walking around his town 's wooded areas .
since it was autumn the leaves were turning red and orange .
putting his feet on the rocks helped connect him to the earth .
the railroad company have a bridge over the river that he used to see as a kid .

i decided to go to the park with my friend .

despite a beautiful sight , everyone managed to get lost since it was dark outside .
thankfully it was turning into day time .
we approached the top of the hill to get a better view .
and were able to see the area with all of the cabins .
the wilderness is really quite when you go camping .
we watched the sun go down .
the light faded over the hill .
the trees were just shadows on the horizon .
the light was almost gone when we decided to go to bed .

the <UNK> crowd went outside and <UNK> her car .
she went outside to see what was going on and somebody stole her guitar .
we get kinda loud when we 're practicing .

tuning up for a little jam session tonight .
the lead singer plays the guitar , she has a great voice too .
this is an electric guitar that will go well with the sound of an <UNK> guitar .
when you are in the music you forget about everything around you .
this was a cool way to play some music and see what people think about it .
[female] was performing at a small gathering of people . she played her guitar and sang .
the people did not go near her and stayed at the far end of the room .
[female] wondered was her singing bad ? she decided to just play the guitar .
she knew a lot of songs and played them all .
when [female] was finished , it was location 's turn to play guitar for the crowd .
a girl is playing the guitar and singing at the same time .

i went in and found so many neat and wonderful things there , including these crowns with gems .
i also was able to look through a <UNK> of colored stones and gems , and i picked a few
after buying a bag 's worth of craft supplies and gems , i went out of the store and went

i came to visit family .
my little sister was there .
my brother wanted to have a drink .
our cousin was taking a break .
we all sat there and had a good time .
the man was not happy

as they were taking photos .
it is a birthday party and the apartment is decorated .
stars are hanging down from the ceiling .
the birthday boys starts opening his presents .

he makes his wish and blows out the candles .
opening up one of many presents .
he received a great shirt for his birthday .
gaming gloves always make a good gift .
after awhile things started to get blurry .
i glanced around thinking that the blur was a result of the dim lights .
awkward <UNK> presented themselves onto a canvas , making body parts seem <UNK> .
my vision continued to <UNK> throughout the night , even after [male] opened his gifts .
finally i had to turn on the lights , realizing that the darkness was at fault for my strange vision
`` you 're a star '' was the theme of [male] 's birthday party .
star decorations could be found hanging and in different places .
[male] carefully unwrapped his present by <UNK> the ribbon .
he was so excited to see what was inside once he got it opened .
the stars remained up after his birthday was over so he could remember his day .
the couple was happy
they were dancing in the stars .
the guy got a gift
and saw a figure that he got
before taking photos of the stars again .
the guys were waiting for the hosts to seat them at the table .
it was a different type of restaurant , where the is already awaiting your arrival .
then someone shared a joke about how it was nice for the food to wait on people for a change
not everyone agreed that this was a good technique .
then one guy pointed out that they were seated at the wrong table .
the guys from the office went out to lunch on tuesday .
the gathered by the <UNK> oven for some chicken .

they all had some very interesting things to say .
after a while it got even more crowded .

after we got all the silliness out of us , we had dinner and said good bye .
friends and family having a get together eating and drinking wine .
some friends are acting silly near the end of dinner .
a silly friend puts a couple of <UNK> up his nose .
then his friend gets up onto the table to act all big and bad .
all he can do is laugh as she sits back down . such a good time with friends .
the night started off great with conversation over dinner
he looks like he 's up to no good
then things started to get interesting
she wanted to make sure everyone heard her by standing on the table
he created a custom made oven <UNK>
here we are at the peaceful protest holding our brightly made signs .
there were just a few that did n't want to follow the peaceful rules that were made for this march
the march has started and we are a determined <UNK> .
the police are kept busy during the march making sure that it is kept peaceful .
it seems that more and more people keep showing up to show there support for this march and enjoy doing
my brother and i went to a protest today .
everything going going fine but the police showed up to keep an eye on things .
my brother stayed till night time after having drank all day and was <UNK> around a bit .
just as the sun went down the police sneaked up behind him and placed him under <UNK> .
they placed him in a van with several other prisoners and took him off to jail .
the demonstration starts peacefully with the crowd <UNK> the <UNK> for crowd control .
police presence is visible but is not needed early in the evening .
the crowd breaks the <UNK> .
some have gone too far and break the law .
in order to keep the peace , the <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> away by the police . order is restored
there was a demonstration in the town .
the police were there to keep order .
most people were demonstrating peacefully .
but a few were taken into <UNK> because of <UNK> behavior .
the demonstration continued despite the <UNK> .
the first day of the protest rally was a huge turn out
many people gathered together in a peaceful manner despite the heavy security .
the crowd chanted loud and proud as they walked the streets together .
the <UNK> public servants decided to <UNK> the rights of the people .
the crowd held up many handmade signs in <UNK> off the protest rally .
we came across this tower in the countryside .
i wonder what it is for .
after that , we came across these rock formations .
they went on for miles .
we made messages in the sand .
along our route was a lot of beautiful country scenery .
rock faces covered a lot of the open land .
we saw so many windmills , such as this one .
the scenery with the rocks was something we enjoyed .
we found this carved into one of the rocks .
the windmill seems to be the only man made structure seen for miles .
this windmill seems so old fashioned compared to the ones in the back ground .
these rock structures have been here for millions of years .
the structures make an awe inspiring view .
it would seem that jim also appreciated the rock structures and wanted all that passed here to know .
during a trip out west we saw <UNK> deserts .
we also visited ancient <UNK> from native americans .
a weather <UNK> and windmill had been standing for a century .
the desert rocks were carved by sand and wind .
we carved our <UNK> into the sand along with the date .
our home is in the <UNK> plains .
in one direction is an old pump windmill with a modern wind farm in the distance .
in another is rocks carved by the wind .
anyone familiar with wind <UNK> can tell you the wind has been carving the stone here longer than man .
not that man has n't managed to a do a bit of carving themselves .
my <UNK> husband waving at me . my back hurts . why did he make me carry the camera ?
disgusting ! we 're not french ! i told my husband i found something more <UNK> than him !
we came across this field full of nasty yellow flowers , and my <UNK> just started acting up .
then , there were these <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> than our marriage .
when i thought our trip could n't get any worse , i saw this . totally in the middle of
here is where we started our hike and the scenery does n't get any better then this .
just about stepped on mr. <UNK> as he was crossing the trail .
just when i thought the hike could n't get any better we came across this very colorful field of flowers
now this is refreshing and a much welcomed site .
i think that this is mother nature at her best and i expect wild horses to show up soon .
standing on the rocks saying hi to the camera .
spotted an <UNK> looking <UNK> , it was a <UNK> <UNK> color .
the grass was filled with purple and yellow flowers .
even found some crystals forming on the side of a rock .
this scene is completely breathtaking , i do n't ever want to leave .
the <UNK> view of this piece of nature reveals some of the beauty of god 's creation .
however , a <UNK> view also shows the magnificence of creation as we see in this small animal .
the flora <UNK> art worthy of any artist .
the evidence of <UNK> being caused by root growth in addition to <UNK> adds interest to the <UNK> view .
finally , life giving water is captured in a small creek that flows from time to time . beauty is
starting my journey
a <UNK> nestled on the rocks
a field of flowers
close up of the rocks i climbed over
the ending shot of the day
here we are at the location restaurant with the famous purple passion tree .
i love looking at all the good tasting food on the menu .
here is my favorite dish the won ton soup .
a meal is not complete without ice cream .
want to make sure we do n't run out of gas on the way home .
as a japanese exchange student i 'm asked quite often about what i find different .
actually , we are quite the same . we have our version of <UNK> restaurants .
we also have our traditional restaurants and markets .
<UNK> soup ! our <UNK> hot <UNK> eaten rapidly with <UNK> ( chop sticks ) .
my car . see , we are quite similar to you . : )
this one of the food selections they offer at the chinese restaurant .
everybody is sitting down and eating their meal .
a chinese venue is outside and people are waiting on line to get some food .
this is one of the <UNK> offered at the venue .
a man is getting some gas at a local gas station .
[female] and i decided to go to a local market for something to eat one night . the lights on
there were so many things to choose from , and the menus were pictures which was great for us since
we ended up having a delicious , hot bowl of soup .
then , [female] suggested ice cream for dessert since the soup was kind of spicy .
afterwards , we had to stop for gas . then we went home .
after the long hours on the road , we needed gas and something to eat so we pulled into this
the menu options for meal were almost overwhelming .
i decided to order the chicken soup with rice noodles .
for dessert and ice cream cone was very refreshing .
we nearly forgot the gas after that delicious meal .
as we arrived at the museum , i could n't help but be awed at the scale of the extraordinary
inside was cozy and crowded , with a sculpture pointing the way to the artifact room .
my girlfriends and i <UNK> politely at the nude , bronze <UNK> , arms <UNK> , and rocking his lack
we found the <UNK> room , and found a skull that had a bigger forehead than that girl in the
looking at the mural of the killing of the <UNK> creature by the <UNK> was an entertaining and exciting end
here we are at the church that is holding a <UNK> art display .
this place is huge but there is a crowd that are waiting to go upstairs to see the art work
here is a famous statue pointing the way to more art .
i thought writing with a pen and paper took along time to write with this would have been painful but
i found this to be the most interesting piece of art out of the whole display .
the museum was in an old cathedral .
but it had a very modern interior .
the group walked through the multi <UNK> museum .
the museum even had some old <UNK> .
as well as some ancient art .
this is the front of a very old building , looks like it may be a museum .
once inside i realized it is a museum with so many interesting pieces of old tradition .
there were 3 floors and each of them with themes of all kinds of cultures .
this piece has a very egyptian vibe to it , its powerful .
this one has a very roman greek feel to it and is equally beautiful to the rest .
the museum was very large and beautiful in structure .
many people were enjoying the different exhibits inside .
statues were scattered throughout the museum for everyone to view .
creepy skulls were on display , but it was very interesting to see !
it must have took a long time to create all the sculptures that were inside the museum .
here we are at the location location and waiting to start our tour .
people are just getting here to start our walk through the canyon .
not sure why a guard rail needs to be put up i just hope nobody went over .
here is a picture of our happy guides that were full of information about the location location .
here was are at the end of the trail and it was the best site seeing day ever .
on the last day of our vacation we decided to visit rock mountain .
there were a lot of beautiful mountains .
we noticed as we got there there were workers doing work .
one worker was carrying a huge rock .
he told us part of the park was closed due to the construction so we ended up leaving .
during our stay we visited a beautiful cannon . the pathways leading to the cannon were <UNK> with rocks hammered
the cannon itself was huge and seemed <UNK> .
we then got to see some men <UNK> the boulders into <UNK> pieces for , i imagine , the pathways
the workers seemed very happy .
on the pathway out we could see their current progress .
our project began in a <UNK> , <UNK> but very beautiful locale .
i gathered with other volunteers to use nearby loose rocks to rebuild and <UNK> <UNK> roads and structures .
rocks were brought in by <UNK> and truck for our use .
that 's me in the middle as we began our work with the rocks .
there will be an inscription on that rock describing our mission and from there , the entire valley can be
out trip to the canyon provided us with so many amazing views .
there was much more to do there than just look at the views .
we encountered an area with guides that gave us demonstrations .
many of the guides wore uniforms so we knew they worked at the park .
the walking paths were spacious and had many different places to stop to take photos .
<UNK> were today for the church band .
lots of people came to show their talents .
both singers and musicians showed up
they sang several songs for the judges .
the judges had a touch time <UNK> the final band members .
it was sunday so naturally everyone headed to church .
it was a small congregation so there was n't much of a choir .
but it was definitely a lively bunch .
they sang their hearts out .
and after a riveting performance , the lead priest gave a special sermon .
there were a lot of people <UNK> for the band .
some people had some great talent .
other 's were not so good .
the <UNK> took all day .
the judges looked very tired and disappointed at the end of the day .
practice for our congregation . sing those hymns girl !
<UNK> the lord ! glory be !
he 's the bassist i 've seen in a while .
they sound magical together .
even the elders have turned out to give a listen .
we had our sunday church today .
it was a very <UNK> sermon today .
the music was very soothing .
the choir sang many peaceful songs .
it was a very good sermon today and we all felt very at peace .
today we went on our summer trip .
we went out to the desert for hiking .
my family and i were so excited and met new people .
we even had time to ride the bike .
it was a fun trip and so much new scenery .
we went to location
it was interesting
we met a 7 foot tall man
we rode bikes in the <UNK>
all in all it was a great trip
i spent some time on the mission field in location .
the lands were beautiful .
i spend a little time in a peaceful village .
the roads were dirt .
there also was n't much water .
we decided to visit a third world country .
the fields look different than the ones we are used to .
we saw locals at the fields .
we used our bikes to get to our destination .
lastly , we took a stroll in the fields to get inspiration .
today i visited my home land for the <UNK> time in 4 years
the terrain didnt change much .
this is my grandma grandpa and cousin <UNK> .
the day after i got there i took a bike ride down the old dirt road i must have ridden
then i helped the guys do some <UNK> it was a great visit
first the lady crossed the street .
then another lady crossed the street .
a third lady just stood by watching .
so a fourth lady crossed .
and then came a woman on a bike .
we took a walk through the city .
we found a lot of fun couples .
there was some cute dogs out today .
there 's been a lot of people down on their luck lately .
luckily there are a lot of people out there that help others .
this mother and her children are bundled up for their day in the city .
these best friends enjoy their day together in the big city .
even the dogs must bundle up to ward off the cold today .
this woman knows how to <UNK> load up her bike after a day of shopping .
one must sample the many foods available while visiting our city .
mom and the kids got bundled up and decided to go to the grocery store .
while walking by they saw their friends across the street .
they also saw their neighbor and their dog .
even people they did not know , like the guy on a bike .
either way , they had a great time .
i am spending the day people watching while my wife shops . first up , this matching family .
i like this lady 's boots .
i wonder if he is their owner or just a dog walker .
it is not everyday you see a dog dressed as superman .
my wife approaches empty handed , i am thinking this guy bought everything already .
we took a walk down the pier today .
we stopped here to eat .
we toured this <UNK> place .
we watched the boats .
it was a fun day .
first we saw a bridge .
then had some fish and chips .
then walked down to the beach .
but a fence was in the way .
so we looked at a boat instead .
a man and his dogs are walking to the beach .
along the way they pass the `` go fish '' seafood restaurant .
then they pass `` <UNK> '' salt water <UNK> store .
they know they are close when they pass the old rusty ship .
finally , when they arrive at the beach , the man chats with a friend as the dogs run off
we visited a coastal town in location .
we stopped at a local restaurant for some traditional fish and chips .
next , we bought some salt water <UNK> at location .
we sat by the waterside and watched the fishing boats .
then we took a walk on the boardwalk .
early in the afternoon we decided to take a trip down to the wharf .
first we stopped to eat at our favorite fish restaurant .
for dessert , we bought some fresh <UNK> .
we enjoyed our snack while watch the workers loading one of the big ships .
at the end of the day we stopped to watch the sunset and listen to the waves .
the wine glass needs washed .
the tea kettle needs washed .
i will wash them together . what is the worst that might happen ?
oops , wine glasses are <UNK> .
<UNK> it ! time for some new glasses .
this glass is dirty and needs to be washed .
it has broken , luckily it is still intact .
the glass has shattered , at least it is still mostly in one piece .
now the glass has broken all over the place !
somebody is going to have to clean up this huge mess !
we had a brilliant idea to place <UNK> into a wine glass .
we carried the <UNK> in a ceramic tea pot .
and , then , we let it happen . a quick poor and turned it upside down !
it did not turn out well , as the wine glass received terrible damage , starting with a hole .
and , <UNK> in complete destruction .
i was washing dishes yesterday and i broke one of my best wine glasses .
it was my favorite one .
i really liked it .
all of the glass pieces were really sharp and i hurt myself trying to clean them up .
i have to be more careful next time .
bubbles are seen at the bottom of the glass .
the tea pot is dark brown and light brown .
the tea pot and glass with bubbles are next to each other .
the glass cracks .
the glass <UNK> and lays on the table .
it was an overcast day at the beach but the waves were perfect for a day of surfing .
he studied the ocean and picked out the area he wanted to surf .
they headed out to conquer the waves .
after a light rain a beautiful rainbow appeared in the sky .
the guys decided to make the most of the weather and surf until dark .
the weather was shaping up to be perfect for surfer school .
the guys first practiced on the sand .
the water was colder than they expected .
the rainbow made us feel as if was going to be a good day .
he finally had success .
the waves were calm today
which made it a great day for a surf lesson . the boys laid on their surfboards and learned how
and then they got in the water and tried it out .
a rainbow started to form above the water as the boys swam out to catch some waves .
when they came back in , they were so excited that they had actually <UNK> !
crappy looking day is perfect for surfing .
check out that swell .
let 's get out there !
beautiful double rainbow . a good sign for some good surf .
here we go !
i went to learn to surf on the coast .
[male] pointed out a rainbow .
here we are going out to sea .
here 's the rainbow in the background .
i <UNK> my first wave !
finally the speaker arrives .
people were eager for the conference to begin .
there were many speakers that day .
people made small talk while waiting .
afterwards , everybody took a photo together .
it was a big event today .
there was lots of food .
one guy even wore <UNK> !
they applauded him .
because he was so diverse .
it does n't matter what the occasion ...
when a politician speaks , someone is going to struggle to stay awake .
that does n't make what is said during the speeches any less important , however .
it 's just that some people are just not as engaging as others .
because any group of people , for any purpose , is still made of individuals .
getting ready to have a celebrating
the man is making a speak to the crowd
he is owning a employee
getting ready to make a toss
taking a group picture together
the three of us are at an event .

when we got back , [female] had finished her snowman
cold and snowy winter days
are perfect for building a snow man .

to pack into balls to form the snow man 's figure .
but once you find the perfect snow , the body really comes together , and a snowman is made .

[female] was so excited that she jumped for joy .

we walked down the street and looked for fun things to do .
a local band was playing and they made us dance .
the guitarist was very good and we want to watch another concert just for them .

as a nature photographer [male] has a good eye for beautiful scenery .
he photographs a rock wall .
he also photographs a tree and it 's roots .
but <UNK> favorite thing in nature to photograph is flowers .
[male] loved this big tree
located in the cows pasture .
the birds loved it as well
because , you see , there was a secret bird feeder on the tree that they would feed from .
after feeding from the secret bird feeder , they would fly off over the lake and into the clouds .
a man taking a picture under a beautiful tree .
out in the open fields , with live cattle allowed to roam around freely .

the views were vast and serene .
i had gone a long way from home .
i found a pool of water , where rested for the end of the day .
we try and find rare <UNK> in the desert each year , here is an example of one .
we had to climb this mountain in order to find some of the <UNK> .
my wife and i love to hunt for these rare beauties together , it helps our relationship .
we are a little tired from climbing that mountain and are starting to walk back to our car .

after the train passed , [male] continued <UNK> along without a care in the world .
`` look , '' he said to himself , `` i think i 'm going to climb that tree .
the train look us to the location of the hike .
the mountains we are hiking on are very high .
even though the mountains are high , there are animals who make their homes up there .
there are even trees growing alongside the mountains .
when you look down , the view from the top is breathtaking .
i got off the train at the station .
it was desolate around here .
there was a squirrel watching me .
i walked to the top of the cliff and looked out .
the view was amazing .
the squirrel waited at the side of the road for the <UNK> moment to cross ,
so that he could get back to his little whole on the side of the canyon .
he had to wait for the train to come through though ,
so that he could safely make it back
to his home on the canyon .
our trip to the location location was fantastic .
there were so many great views of the canyon .

no one else was around .
i decided to leave and head back home .
we saw the location location sign which meant we reached our halfway point .
we still had miles to go .
we passed by a lot of abandoned equipment .
instead of driving overnight , we decided to set up a campsite .
eventually after five days of driving we arrived at our new home in a small part of location .
we were getting close . and , we knew in our hearts , we would find that gold .
we continued up the mountain , it seemed like days .
and , finally , we reached our camp .
we rested by the fire for the night because tomorrow was the start of our journey .

the machine had become <UNK> , so i had one last look at them before i had to leave .
we took a trip through the mountain roads .
the scenic views were beautiful and vast .
by the <UNK> there were these funny looking boats .
the coastline was made of rock instead of sand .
we rented this boat and took it out to see more beautiful landscape .
i had a lot of work to do in my backyard .
there was a lot of grass growing that needed to be cut .
i also needed to replace the entire fence .
some of the steps were crumbling .
it was dangerous work .
the garden had been abandoned since she left .
the old fence needed repairs .
vines climbed everywhere .
she leaned against the building and wondered how she would ever get it back like it once was .
she vowed to never leave for that long again .
i 've been hiding in this bush for days in order to sneak into someones house .
i 've been waiting for the perfect moment to sneak in , everyone is gone so it 's time to

the scene is <UNK> by the shrubbery .
the rustic gate blended well with the scene .
the stairs led up to the house , which was in slight disrepair .

the hotel was so nice !
the evil <UNK> 's <UNK> crushed , we headed back to headquarters .
driving over <UNK> , we made it there in no time .

the scene of serenity with a rusted old relic .
driving through the canopy gives them a feeling of peace .

they were all apart of a volunteer group .
their job was simple , they had to spend the day putting the plants in the ground .
the finished product was exactly what they wanted .
and it will benefit the environment greatly .
we decided to visit the old train station with a organization wheel .
there was no one else there .
the tracks were all empty except for one train by itself .
we saw the ferris wheel in the back . there was no one on it .
we decided to leave because it was getting creepy .
it was really dark that night .
i took a picture that was blurry .
so i tried to take it again .

so , the lone <UNK> <UNK> waited .
his confidence began to <UNK> as the end of the train got ever closer .
but , even after the train was well out of site , he saw no <UNK> .
still , his nerves could n't take it , and he ran .
the old village looked just like he remembered it .
the red house was the 1st thing he saw at the edge of town .
next came the little yellow house next door to where he had <UNK> .
at last there it was !
his home , decorated for christmas and to welcome him there !
how could anyone have believed that witches once lived here ?
an old man told them some people there still believed in witches .
he was quite the character .
it was <UNK> that two witches had lived in this old house .
this old house supposedly was home to an <UNK> , who they believed was a witch .
the tour of the historic village started with a look at a large , perfectly restored <UNK> house .
the next home had a lovely tree and bench to rest outside .
one person could n't resist <UNK> in the nice space .
the steel gray blue home of [male] <UNK> was also on the tour .
my favorite detail from the tour were beautifully crafted doors that looked almost like a valentine .
historic homes are plentiful in my home town .
the columns on this porch are <UNK> .
the large tree in the yard is a perfect accent to the brick <UNK> home .

what an entryway . lets give it a little make over to make it pop .
the old church was in the center of town .
this historic house is over 200 years old .
this historic house only has one room .
this house was built for the 1st mayor of the town .
the town mayor lives in this town now .
from a distance the city looked large .
it was situated on the sea .
surprisingly , there were many buildings in ruin .
they were considered historical sites so nobody dared tear them down .
even the newer houses that had been built had an ancient feel to them .
the old structures stood tall , as the couple explored the ruins .
they looked at the pieces at all angles , seeing so many sides to the story .
they gazed out at the water , wondering what life was like here so long ago .
not all of it was in great shape , they noted , some did see the test of time .
but in general , the couple was very impressed with the ability of the architecture to stand up to time
this is a very old ancient city , with what they call ruins everywhere .
i would have loved to have seen when it was all built up .
tourists come from miles around to see these old rare structures .
these columns were built so long ago , its a wonder that they are still standing .
i wonder who lived here and what they did for a living .
the tour of the location island stared at the outskirts of the city .
the first stop was an old sea fort .
much of the original structure was still intact .

the white buildings were illuminated by lights in the lawn .
the streets had a vintage quality to them .
tunnels were enchanting and mysterious .
some of the statues in town were very creepy and gave off a dark vibe .
it 's nighttime in the city . the lake in the park reflects the streetlights .
it 's so late out , that no one is around . it 's quiet and peaceful .
i walk by the monument and there are no tourists around .
the moon is shining brightly up in the sky .
everyone is at home and it 's peaceful in the city .
the man went to the skating rink by himself .
then he began to walk around the city .
the monuments of the city took him away .
he felt alone on this night
the wonders of the city always made him get over his <UNK> .

which makes it the best place to go to be alone and to reflect on your life .
in the distance , the winding road led to an old church that contrasted against he <UNK> sky .
the weather seemed like it may take a turn for the worst , but against the outline of a fence

we saw a lone cow sitting in the field and decided not to bother it .
we spent the entire day wandering around the acres of farmland in location . it was an amazing part of
old building rusty and in bad shape with roof falling in
looking at the barn from a distance looks old and down
and on the side kind of torn real bad
the old barn is made of wood and tin
barn can be repaired and fixed up but going to take some time
this is my families farm in the desert .
its not in the best shape but its home .
the whole place could use a fair bit of work .

in a different part of the <UNK> , you can see the rocky waterfall .
we decided to go hiking after seeing this picture in a brochure .
we wanted to get away from our town to <UNK> ourselves .

it was hard and it seemed barren without the leaves on the trees .
but it was worth it when we found this awesome waterfall .
it looks so far down when viewing from the top side of a mountain
the view of the city is so different when looking from above
the trees seem more welcoming when you look down into them

after we spent all afternoon there we went home to get something to eat .
abandoned places are sometimes the prettiest .
the structures may be rusted ,
but their patterns still remain .
they may not be as pretty as they once were ,
but there 's a subtle , different kind of beauty to empty places
she posed in front of the old ruins .
the water still came rushing out of the tunnel probably the same way it did all those years ago .
a reflection pool was in the middle of the ruins and they wondered how that was possible .
standing on top of the old wall they could look down and see the elaborate design of what would have

name plates gave detail behind each plant .
smaller tree plants were popular .
the green life <UNK> onto the walkway .
these flowers starts out very slow growing
once they get plenty sunshine and water they seems to grow a little
but they have to stay in a sun room area for protection
because once they start blooming they are pretty
and starts to grow crazy
we traveled to a lively greenhouse for a day .
there were so many beautiful ferns .
i saw green and <UNK> flowers .
the <UNK> flowers interested my partner .
we had to closely examine the plants for their feel .
some friends and i took a nice day trip to a local nursery .
in there green house they had some amazing flowers .

this was a display of some trees that grow only in the rainforest .
i thought this nursery was absolutely beautiful .
today we visited the botanical garden . the building is quite and the entrance is surprisingly ordered and formal in
these yellow flowers remind me of some in my grandmother 's yard .
winter <UNK> is pictured here . what a neat name for a plant with such interesting blooms .
i especially liked these miniature trees . they look like they were pulled straight out of a forest .
we visited the botanical garden at just the right time to see all of these lovely blooms . the greenery
we went to an art and learning center .
the building was wide on the inside and very decorated .
the outside of the building was tall and wide .

we decided to go to the international building .
there were plants inside the building .
it really stands out in the skyline with it 's architecture .
many people were out that day in this section of town .
as we leave we can see the flags from all around the world .
the storefront had displays in a cube shelf with a bench along side it .
as they walked up the stairs they could see banners outside the windows .
once upstairs they were welcomed by a large informative poster .
they were able to watch some of the artists at work .
when they reached the top floor , they could look down on the patio where many of the artists would

it was a long walk back to the car .
we 're out here checking out this awesome park .
exploring some the caves .
what a sight this is to see .

there 's everything you can see from here .
our tour guide was knowledgeable .
he knew all the areas to explore .
we traveled <UNK> trails .
saw neat natural wonders .
took in the sights all around .
today was a great day for a hike .
we stumbled by this cave . looks like it 's a door made especially for us !
the area is really beautiful . lots of <UNK> .
if i did n't grow up so near nature , i 'd think this tree was alien .
glad i did grow up here though . so amazing to just look at .
this is a old house
that has a lot of work to be done on
the windows need a lot of repairing from broken glass
and also the area of the house needs to be clean
but overall the land can be brought back up to living status
i love old houses , but this one reminds me of the house out of organization organization organization .
the gingerbread <UNK> on this one is awesome .
the corner tower on this one would neat from the inside . three story <UNK> it .
this house would be fantastic if someone would fix it up . needs lots of <UNK> .
this looks like it was a church at one time . all that antique furniture would look good in my
this is one of the oldest houses in this historic area .
this one has been renovated quite a bit .
this one just might be my favorite .
however , this one is the largest one i saw .
and here you can buy little <UNK> .
these pictures are from our tour of historical and original one of a kind homes .
this beautiful home has a wrap around porch with a built in swing .
the tower on this home makes it feel and look so special .
although this home was the most run down the inside was immaculate .
at the end of the tour there was a little shop with an outdoor market .
this was part of my summer road trip though some east coast cities this summer .
i got to go through some of the back roads and see some old towns .
there was many abandoned building that had a lot of history .
this road creeped my out so i had to turn around .
these trees were very early in getting their fall colors .
a big tower of a building is constructed in this city .
another big building looms over the city .
another building stands off in the distance . this building is rather new .
another new building is being constructed . the new buildings should help the economy and generate a ton of new
another building is being built . this city is becoming more and more modern .
i wanted to show off my <UNK> .
there is a building close to where i live .
this is my office where i work , i just got a new job .
looks like some bad weather could be moving in .
but then the sun comes out !
in this city , there is a big contrast between the old and new buildings .
older office buildings and <UNK> tended to be made of brick , and their windows were small .
the newer skyscrapers use a lot of glass and steel , and it 's interesting to see the reflections of
construction is going on all over the city . in a few years , the skyline will look very different
this new building towers over its older neighbors -- there 's a great view from the upper floors !
skyscrapers weekly , the magazine where you can view skyscrapers of all shapes and sizes .
where you can study the architectural <UNK> .
the people who designed the buildings .
the teams that built the buildings .
and the final impact the structures had on their surrounding cities . this was the magazine he dreamed of creating
there are lots of large buildings all <UNK> together in the city .
this building looks enormous from this angle .
this building really stands out in the city skyline .
it must be scary to work on a building that far up .
so much activity in these buildings .
the city had several famous districts .
there was a street that was very popular .
the center of government was popular with tourists .
visitors lined up outside to get a better glimpse .
other historical monuments were just minutes away .
i went on a trip .
to location location .
i saw lots of neat buildings .
and open spaces .
like this cool park .
we visited location location lately .
first , we saw the organization organization .
next , we went to visit the organization building .
from afar , we can even see the location monument .
the lake leading to the location location was gorgeous too .
there were no buses allowed on this corner .
then they realized they were on location <UNK> .
they walked past the organization organization .
several tourists were standing outside the iron fence taking pictures .
they could see the location monument was within walking distance .
we 're traveling somewhere , can you guess where we are from this photograph of a street we walked along
location <UNK> ! we 're getting closer .
today we went to the organization organization .
the day was nice and a number of other tourists were out and about taking pictures in front of the
here 's an image of the location location that i took later in the day .

we found this cat along the route to the market .
we were able to find nice fabric and <UNK> at the shop .
on our vacation we got to see many large bodies of water .
the brick structure was massive and torn down .
this part of the brick structure was still up and could be <UNK> .
we got to see the remains of an old arena .
our cat was amused by the entire trip and really enjoyed it .
it was a long hike through the scenic country side to get to the ruins .
the first building we saw as we headed into the ruins . it was the most complete of the ruins
the amphitheater was very hard to recognize from the road because of how low the seats were .
there was a local cat that was there , watching us as we looked around .
once we got back , we checked out the market to pick up some <UNK> .
the views are breathtaking in this small town .
the history comes to life .
everyone who comes here comes for the sights .
even a cat can appreciate it .
the locals make their money by selling art work that represents the sights .
the scenery surrounding the area is beautiful .

look at all of those stones . it is incredible how all of this has been recovered .
even the cats like to hang out here too .
there are lots of lovely things for sale in the nearby shops . this store sells mainly <UNK> .
the entrance way to the building was very inviting .
there were all these little papers hanging on the tree .
i found out later that they were wishes that people had placed there .
the dragon was supposedly going to <UNK> your wishes .
it was a very detailed dragon with a lot of powers , i guess .
visited a temple today . i 've never seen one in person before .
the walkway up to the temple . very calm and peaceful .
notes people have left for the monks .
more notes , but these are prayers that they hope will be answered .
a dragon the guards the temple . it was a once in a lifetime trip .
shrines are a major part of asian life .
many shrine visitors write wishes and prayers on little pieces of paper ,
and then they tie those pieces of paper to tree branches around the shrine .
they pray to the gods of the shrine
to <UNK> their hopes and dreams .
we are traveling again .
today we are at a church in location . to celebrate the coming year .
it is the year of the horse !
the customs here are so charming .

when we got outside , it was still daylight .
our trip to the mountains was held up by bad weather .
so we toured the river instead .
we found our camping spot .
after <UNK> through the woods we found food .
we were happy to be at the river instead of the mountain .
the travelers went out to find a trail in the wilderness .
they hiked along a river .
it was cold out so they had to dress appropriately .
they enjoyed spending time together in the wilderness .
the beautiful area provided wonderful photo opportunities .
many tourists visited this national park .
the scenery was breathtaking .
the man came here to hike .
he met two other hikers and they started to talk .
an elderly couple asked the hiker to take their picture . he was happy to do so . he could

we stopped by a historical train track that was still being used .
we got to listen to piano music at a local cafe .
we stopped by a bar for a drink and were surprised to see the delightful man with the hat .
we enjoyed walking through town exploring the shops . .
we watched the television and laughed .
on the wall , was a display of tennis <UNK> .
the grill was very useful in making our food .
we went inside to <UNK> the pictures we had on the wall .
the store was full of random items .
the television in the hotel room was small .
so we got better seats .
we had our ticket but could n't get in .
so we packed out stuff for the trip .
we were then going to start in the tents .
during our trip to location location we saw many odd things .
there was a museum devoted to <UNK> . these were traditional <UNK> .

maybe spend some looking at pictures and <UNK> in your office .
last , get a good feel of your trophies from all your hard work .
the storm ruined so many homes .
looks like it ripped the front off the house and piled it up .
it even blew this boat up on shore and into a yard .
oh wow ! ! it picked up this car and dropped it on top of that truck .
oh those poor people . the storm destroyed their entire house .
the house is empty and abandoned
needs a lot of attention to this house
also the yard needs work
but after all the house can be repaired and look different
and brought back to life
our home , after we cleaned the all the debris up .
this is my neighbor 's home and what it looked like after the tornado . they were lucky .
this boat had to be tossed over twenty miles to land here .
that 's my friend 's car that 's sitting on top of my truck !
we were hit hard , but just down the street , our neighbors lost everything .
a hurricane struck the town .
it damaged the houses and telephone poles .
even a boat laid on the yard of a house .
cars were on top of each other .
lastly , this was the best depiction of what a hurricane can do .
you could see the <UNK> the tornado left in it 's wake driving through the small town .
you can see electrical lines destroyed .
boats barely standing up .
cars piled on top of each other .
and houses torn apart .
i went for a walk yesterday .
there were a lot of signs posted .
i could n't read some of them .
when i got to downtown i kept walking .
i saw the church in the distance .
a meeting was to be held at a local building .
the people arrived on time to discuss the future of their community .
the people gathered in a big group inside the building
the building was too small , so the people moved outside .
a man gave a speech outside letting everyone know what would happen .
the first building was had a <UNK> look about it .
everybody seems to be headed to the small white house .
there was a crush of people waiting to get in .
others were waiting outside .
the man is giving a lecture about the history of the house .
the narrow roads made it difficult for travel .
the welcomed us with a banner hanging across .
we know that the next town would be a little farther .
their attractions were better though .
they also had better parking .
the union organizer arrived in town the day of the meeting .
the mill 's parking lot was packed .
there was no room for anyone to sit inside .
the meeting was taken outside and the crowd was still standing room only .
workers , families , everyone listened as the union <UNK> listed all the benefits of <UNK> .
we traveled to visit a great city .
the bridge was exotic and intricate .
the farmer 's market was fresh and colorful .
we also saw some funny looking cars .
and nature was not forgotten here ; it was beautiful to <UNK> .
this was our first trip here and this was quite a site .
we marveled at the architecture on this bridge .
the open markets were very lively and colorful .
the state buildings were adorned with flags on the street .
before we left , we saw these cute cars .
cities rich in history are the best cities to visit .
the architecture and bridges are gorgeous .
the local markets remind us of the simplest things in life .
if you are feeling adventurous , you can rent little carts to explore the city .
the best part of the city , is its beauty and how it <UNK> nature , culture , and civilization
the whole family was excited for their trip to location .
everyone was amazed by the beautiful architecture .
we stopped at a local fruit market , everything looked delicious .
we had a great time exploring the city throughout the day .
we ended the day by hiring a taxi to take us to our hotel .
we wanted to visit a <UNK> country .
this was my first time out of the location location .
this country has such good food !
and they have unique cars .
i was really fascinated with the nature over there .
i decided to go diving today .
i went just far enough to get to a <UNK> .
i got lucky and saw many schools of fish .
i even saw a <UNK> <UNK> !
this coral is the most beautiful one i saw all day .
the aquatic center had shells for sell .
looking under the water seemed like another world .
the fish had their freedom to swim wherever .
the <UNK> <UNK> still looked intimidating .
i love seeing the animals interact .
we visited an aquarium that had a little <UNK> outside .
the <UNK> were lovely .
and the brightly colored fish swimming in schools were <UNK> .
the <UNK> was fun to watch .
the <UNK> <UNK> in the water , like they were waving us goodbye .
life underwater is exciting .
there are several different types of fish ,
some who swim in packs !
there are also <UNK> rays , but <UNK> they do n't <UNK> you !
on top of that , you can see several underwater plants that are all alive and use the water to
a trip to the ocean offers many interesting things to look at , both on shore and underwater .
you can find fish feeding on coral .
it 's fun to see whole schools of beautiful fish .
if you 're lucky , you might see a <UNK> <UNK> .
you might even get to see some marine life in bloom .
taking black & white photos is my favorite . this is an old bridge i found one day .
our house by the beach so much better photographed this way .
the beach looks like it belongs in an old movie .
you could almost feel a ghost watching you from down the lane .
[male] sitting on the bench watching the waves . very cool .
the bridge was a little scary .
so we decided to take the path .
we arrived at the little bungalow .
the way back was the path .
we found our destination .
photos <UNK> in black and white can often catch the essence of a picture , like this bridge for instance
even a small set of land with a tree can make a photo look very unique .
the most breathtaking photos are the ones taken at the beach .
if <UNK> the right way the photographer can catch the clouds and water coming in perfect .
but sometimes something simple as a person watching the ocean can be a great photo .
the bridge to the island where we rented the house for vacation .
this is the outside view of the house we rented for vacation .
the view of the shore from the patio at the house .
some really nice views just a ways from the house .
there was a nice walking path just a few minutes from the house .
small coastal towns have a lot of beauty if you look closely .
the homes here are more modest in size .
rock formations are <UNK> along the coastline . they are visually appealing , but make swimming dangerous .
though it was a cloudy day , we still got a lot of nice pictures .
it 's so relaxing to sit on the park bench and look out over the water .
several people came out for the home viewing .
the grounds were <UNK> with plants .
the green shrubs made the yard stand out .
and provide shade for the home .
<UNK> were just a few of the <UNK> to this home .
this is my brothers new house we went to visit and bring a house warming gift .
the side yard had a lot of plants and bushes with a bunch of trees .
a side view of the house you can catch the <UNK> was so beautiful there .
my brothers wife loves plants and has a small patio garden near the back door .
here is another patio which would be great for bbq 's and other gatherings .
the people took a tour of the beautiful home .
the landscaping added to the appeal of the home .
the architecture was interesting and ornate .
the entire plot was lush and beautiful .
it was a great home to tour to get a glimpse into <UNK> 's architecture .
its time for our landscape reveal party !
fortunately we were able to get some of our grandfathers prized plants from his garden
look at our glorious back yard oasis !
the privacy we 've created is astonishing !
look at the beautiful tree blooming by the garage - even the side of the yard is a secret getaway
this house is for sale .
the landscaping on this house well put together .
the house has a lot of curb appeal .
the owners want to sell the house for $ <UNK> .
they hope it sells soon .
i went to go see a large cathedral .
the ceilings were so high and <UNK> tall .
the seats and stage were extravagant and fit so many people .
there was a large statue in the church , and it represented their god .
there was also an inscription below various statues .
today we went back to our roots . the first church in history .
the chapel was beautiful and ready to be filled with people .
this is the <UNK> place where jesus <UNK> .
he also had his hand in making this beautiful pane .
we ended the day rehearsing with the choir .
the castle stood high above .
we entered the ancient church .
everything was <UNK> .
the stain glass took years to craft .
the choir began soon after we entered .
the cathedral looms over the town . it 's gothic architecture giving it the appearance of a screaming man .
inside though are <UNK> ceilings , brightly painted in white and filled with graceful arches .
light , pillars , and graceful curves are designed to bring the eyes to the center .
statues grace the halls , giving those that pass through their blessings .
all is not cheerful inside , though . there are reminders of darker times .
this grand church is a monument to the city .
the inside is historic and rich . what a spectacle !
the <UNK> fountain has seen many a new [male] child .
the stained glass windows are full of color and grace .
as the choir sings , the congregation joins in with song .
we went to the park to do research on windmills .
we were allowed to see the biggest windmill from up close .
inside , we were able to see the <UNK> .
up close , we were able to see the gears that turned the windmill .
we went online to write what we had learned .
visiting a working windmill .
the <UNK> explains how the windmill works .
giant machinery inside the windmill .
a small piece of machinery helps the windmill keep working .
another photo of the inner <UNK> of the windmill .
our small town decided to <UNK> our windmill .
the governor of our town talked about the importance of the windmill . the windmill was used to bring electricity
the windmill featured gears made out of <UNK> and wood .
an operator is used to operate the windmill with a <UNK> in case their is an electricity shortage .
a few of the gears inside the windmill had to be replaced and <UNK> . the gears were wearing thin
this is annual dutch fan completion ceremony .
this fan currently stands at 20 feet tall .
this is the <UNK> what makes it turn .
<UNK> and personal <UNK> , so wonderfully crafted .
if you would like to see on the computer here is the website .
[female] set up a fun day for us at the park .
the windmill was large and very intimidating .
it look a lot of big gears to make it work .
the <UNK> were made of old wood .
i checked on the internet to see exactly where we were .
i have always lived inland during my younger years and have a <UNK> for the sea now and i am
i enjoy traveling around looking for where i would like to spend the rest of my days and i love
this house was one that i would have loved to buy if it had been for sale because i thought
i found this home beautifully landscaped and just the perfect size for myself and what i have to fill it
i suppose i will keep on with my search to find that perfect cottage by the sea and to take
my friend asked me if i wanted to go <UNK> .
i got one look at the entrance and decided not to go .
while we were there we found a creepy old door .
what could possibly be behind it ?
we found this carving in a tree that 's nearly 100 years old .
we arrived in the beach community and began the journey toward our new home .
we could n't believe the beauty when we found the home and they even provided a bike for our journeys
i noticed the porch , while [male] was happy to see the air <UNK> !
we continued to move around the exterior of the home , loving every second of it .
and , finally , we headed toward the back entrance .
this quiet , seaside town was the perfect site for me to work on my book .
i rented a bicycle and a room in this cottage .
most days i was in my room upstairs , writing my story .
my neighbor lived here , and she helped me type my work .
when i needed a break or needed inspiration , i 'd bicycle around town , admiring the <UNK> lifestyle .
started the morning right with a jog to the beach .
the neighborhood was very picturesque but quiet .
the beautifully decorated <UNK> seemed lonely .
the front gardens were well maintained but no one was available for me to compliment .
feeling refreshed and ready to lounge on the deck chairs in front of my lovely home .
when the sun rose in the morning , i woke up and got ready .
my cat was already up and playing .
we headed to the open building near the grassy plain .
the space was so open and broad .
we were really excited to witness such a nice piece of architecture .
there was a cute stray cat making the soil his home .
the man found a good resting place when visiting the monument .
it had amazing architecture and the walls were so smooth .
the center of object was very unique and intriguing .
he posed for another picture before he left .
the sunset <UNK> a beautiful light over the town .
the next day the cat started acting strange .
even the fields was more empty than usual .
we went to the stadium and surprisingly we were all alone .
we were all alone in the town , everyone disappeared .
this is missy the cat , she is sad because her owner is on vacation .
missy 's owner [male] is visiting one of his favorite sport <UNK> .
he has managed to get every angle he could for some great pictures .
but nothing beats the picture of actual stadium itself .
[male] has had a nice vacation but now wants to head home to see his cat missy .
the small kitten had a unique personality .
almost as unique as his .
he had found it at work .
someone had abandoned it in the stadium .
they probably knew someone would be a <UNK> for it and he was the <UNK> .
i love to look at castle ruins .
the outside was overgrown with <UNK> .
just inside was an out of place lone palm tree .
i try to imagine who once rode through these gates .
oh the stories these old walls could tell .
they arrived at the old building early in the morning .
the van was left parked outside .
the structure was in a state of disrepair .
it was so rundown that they felt uncomfortable walking under anything .
parts of the roof had already <UNK> in .
we discovered some mysterious ruins in the woods .
we drove up to them to get a closer look , and to explore .
i could n't believe how elaborate they were .
this dome of brick could not have been easy to build .
the broken arch was amazing .
history surrounds this stone entrance way .
the rock quarry has trucks running through it .
the castle stands after decades of time passed by .
the openings are splendid works of <UNK> .
wear and tear over the years is evident between the stone walls .
they went on vacation to visit the ancient ruins .
they walked along the path where the people used to walk .
they took pictures of the trees are common in that area .
they took pictures of the intricate designs of the building .
they took distant pictures of the buildings where the ancient civilization lived .
a <UNK> sign advertising breakfast .
inside the <UNK> with more choices for food .
what a hearty breakfast this is .
a gargoyle outside the church which is protective .
beautiful stained glass windows .
after a big sunday breakfast , i walk to church .
to get there , i walk over the n bridge .
i try to get there early to enjoy the beauty of the stain glass windows while the church is quiet
once more people arrive , the church service starts and all the people pay attention .
i think even the statues in the church pay attention to the sermon .
the street cafe was perfect for breaking our morning fast .
they offered many <UNK> .
i had the traditional english breakfast .
we then headed to the cathedral . the gargoyles were like none i had ever seen .
inside , the blue stain glass windows gave it a beautiful unique feel .
when i told [female] that we were coming to this city she told us we must stop here for breakfast
i am so glad that we took her idea . here is a price list that was difficult to understand
but when we got the food served to us we were so pleased ! best coffee that i have ever
after breakfast we went site seeing and we came across a couple of items that we just had to photograph
the windows we photographed inside a church were majestic . i think that i would like these in my home
[female] 's favorite cafe is french .
they have a great drink menu filled with different types of <UNK> and <UNK> ,
but best of all , they have great breakfast foods that you can mix with lunch sandwiches !
the outside of the building has fancy french architecture ,
and the inside definitely reflects the outside . she loves feeling like she 's in a foreign country when she
my friends and i went on a vacation at a water cabin .
we jumped into the water and made great <UNK> !
there were also historical buildings near by .
i also had lunch with my mother .
later , we went on a boat ride in the river .
we left the cold to go to a warm climate for vacation .
first day we swam in the water and jumped off the rocks .
this is the water we swam in around the castle .
this is the other side of the moat . nice houses .
the canoe we rode around the moat in most of the day .
these kids are jumping in the water .
this lake is where they swim during the summer .
many of the townspeople hang out at this lake .
mom is glad her kids are leaving her alone for once .
after going for a swim they decide to take a <UNK> out .
the boys caught in mid air jumping off the old bridge .
[male] got the highest of any of the <UNK> .
the town hall looked really cool with the clouds and lighting .
mom sitting down to get some coffee .
our canoe sitting in the driveway ready to be loaded onto the car .
the building was brown
and people were swimming nearby .
there was a big harbor
with homes on it
where people could kayak .
toured an old train museum today . this one is really old .
this one looks like a christmas train . where 's my presents ?
better picture of the old train .
someone put train wheels on a organization bug ... how cool !
this one is really cool looking . kind of art deco looking .
the train exhibit detailed the <UNK> <UNK> cars throughout time .
a variety of vehicles were on display .
older models gave <UNK> of transport years ago .
newer cars could still be found in operation today .
old <UNK> stations can still be viewed today .
we went to a vehicle museum .
we saw old trains such as this one .
this black train was the longest one we saw .
we even saw old <UNK> such as this silver one .
there was all this silver bus or train that was really impressive .
i love trains very much , i also love going to train shows each year and looking at different models
this is a <UNK> model , built in <UNK> , i like to call it the xmas express because of
i moved on to the <UNK> or what i like to call the <UNK> potter express train , one of
here we have a rare train car . only 3 were made , i wish i could have one .
the final train i looked at was this beauty ; the silver bullet , one of the fastest trains in
they were allowed to climb on board the old steam locomotive .
this train had recently been added to the collection .
the old steam locomotive was <UNK> off to avoid people touching it .
this was the smallest train they saw .
this train was from the 1970 's and was considered very <UNK> in its day .
we took a trip to check out some awesome sites .
we went over these beautiful bad boys .
my lame girlfriend wanted to see the location custom house .
so i made her go here out of spite .
everyone agreed that mr. <UNK> graffiti was the coolest of the trip though .
we took a lovely trip to location last summer and had such a wonderful time .
the lighthouses in the ocean are so charming that it kind of makes me want to live here .
the seagulls can be a problem though , so keep your eyes open .
we even took a ride on a horse drawn carriage to our lovely hotel - now <UNK> , [male] .
of course , our hotel had a breathtaking view , as does everything else here .
upon my travels along the beach i come across some strange finds , like this tower in the distance .
i wait until night fall to catch a better glimpse of this strange structure .
i send my scout gull to see if there is anything dangerous , he <UNK> back that it 's clear
i ride my mighty <UNK> towards the structure to maybe find something cool .
upon getting closer , i find this glorious house , which i 'll make my own place to live .
a lighthouse in the distance intrigued my eye holes .
it was the tallest beast in the ocean .
a bird flew overhead across the beach .
a <UNK> horse stood looking bored and tired .
i saw my dream house before i left .
here are some images from our travel . look at this lighthouse - it looks so <UNK> out there in
this bridge looks quite nice lit up at night -- does n't seem as neat in the bright of day
the organization organization organization organization - a historical building in location .
another shot of the organization organization organization organization . the sky was a wonderful blue that day .
some graffiti i was especially excited by . mr. t !
snow covered the grounds heavily in the winter .
the lake was covered in white <UNK> as well .
the yards of homes were blanketed .
the waters looked breathtaking .
some wildlife stayed close to the water .
it was a cold day , but we took advantage of the clear skies and set out to see the
we stopped by the river and saw this .
the seagulls let us know they were there .
the stone on the opposing side looked wonderful covered in the snow .
a city skyline view was the perfect way to end the day .
the snow falls quite deeply around here , bury the flowers .
some grass are too tall and would stick out of the snow .
near the house , it can sometimes be a feet deep . i 'd then have to shovel the snow
it would slowly melt , revealing the dead grass underneath .
when it starts melting , the gulls would come back .
the late snowfall would probably kill the plants .
it was n't very deep enough to kill the <UNK> weeds that grew close the the gazebo .
for some reason the snow was deeper in his backyard .
across the water he could see the island had very little snow .
in some places you could see the grass and the poor birds <UNK> for food .
the ground covered in at least 3 inches of snow .
the gazebo by the lake .
two birds <UNK> for food .
the beautiful view of a winter wonderland .
a covered yacht and a city view in the background .
i went to the lake yesterday .
the water was very calm .
the shoreline was beautiful .
there was some trees that had fallen .
i took a lot of pictures there .
we went to a river near by on a vacation .
we found sailboats fishing for different fishes .
we even found eggs on the <UNK> !
then we found a jellyfish on land .
the whole time we were being watched by two <UNK> birds .
we went to the beach , yesterday .
it was a nice day to be on the shore .
i found a really cool jelly fish .
we saw some really neat stuff there .
at the end of the day , i was very relaxed .
on vacation on the islands taking in the incredible view .
the day was sunny with a brisk wind , good news for the sailboats on the water .
the beach was littered with odds and ends including <UNK> fruits .
found one poor jellyfish <UNK> on the rocks .
while a pair of parrots observed over head .
some people call our vacation spot paradise .
there would certainly be an argument for that , especially when you look out at the boats .
however , the beach is covered with with extremely odd jellyfish type animals .
they are enough to completely freak you out .
then you see something like the parrots , and you are thinking paradise again .
when i got to the restaurant it was very dark .
there were some lights there .
i had a great time at the restaurant .
afterward i took a cab back home .
there were a lot of stairs leading down to my apartment .
i finally visited location location .
just like in the pictures , many places had balconies .
this kind of thing is typical for location location .
they often watch mardi gras from balconies like this one .
they are always having some kind of festival there .
we started the journey toward dinner and it was a long walk .
we helped a man plant a flower on the way down .
which , made [male] rather tired and pondering if it was worth it .
we finally arrived at dinner and the tables were lovely .
and , following dinner , we started our journey back home .
we went out to eat last night .
the town was known for it good restaurants .
the food was wonderful .
the view from the restaurants windows was spectacular .
our walk home in the city was refreshing .
the entrance of the restaurant has a view of the city .
<UNK> are outside along the garden area .
looking over the porch i admire the landscape .
fresh fruit lines the serving table .
the back side of the restaurant is best being out of sight .
the home had a dish satellite connected to the roof .
there were many vacant homes in the area .
some of the homes in the neighborhood needed major work .
i went home to open my window for <UNK> .
the street was empty with no cars or people .
this beautiful old village we visited last month truly seemed like a testament to human <UNK> .
we could only guess as to the reason why so many homes lay in rubble .
still , life still found a way to <UNK> in the <UNK> conditions . it even <UNK> on the rooftops
fresh graffiti on the walls told a story of people <UNK> and wanting their voices to be heard .
as we left we took note of vibrant life once again , as small children laughed and played in the
on our trip , we saw an abandoned area of the city .
no one lived here as the buildings had been damaged by an earthquake .
weeds were growing on the roof of one of the empty buildings .
some structures had been <UNK> by graffiti .
rubble and trash in the street made the area appear even more desolate .
the old building in this <UNK> town had modern satellite dishes .
the view of the town reveals <UNK> housing .
this must be a very old building that has fallen into disrepair .
it 's a shame this building is so run down .
the old street would be beautiful with a little repair .
there was so much <UNK> after the hurricane .
from one of the higher buildings i could see the <UNK> better .
there were old shops that now had graffiti on them .
some houses had the doors ripped off .
there was so much garbage lining the streets afterwards .
it is boys night ! we have left our women at home and ready to party ! here we are
first thing we did was ski . it was a first time for many of us , but it was
we then came inside and made dinner . [male] and [male] were the chefs for the night .
[male] and [male] decided to do a little jam while we waited for dinner . they are surprisingly good !
now that we have eaten , it is drink time . here we are doing shots . this is going
the outside of the building was very elegant .
there was a nice lamp structure that i enjoyed .
there were also other unique structures that caught my attention .
i wanted to take a picture of every interesting structure .
i had to get a shot of this interesting hotel .
the all guy vacation started off great . a game of beer pong just like back in college .
then it was off to the slopes for some skiing and snowboarding .
afterwards , two of the guys cooked up a delicious meal .
while others rocked out in the living room .
we ended the night with shots ! what a great vacation .
the guys decided to unwind with a friendly game of beer pong .
they all wanted to relax after a long day of skiing .
dinner was finally ready after one short game of beer pong .
after dinner they played video games together .
they ended the night with a few more drinks .
the <UNK> boys were at it again .
a ski trip was the perfect place for some good old fashioned fun .
[male] and [male] made a meal out of what they found along the ski slopes .
[male] and [male] jammed out to a <UNK> 2 <UNK> .
the boys had a special bond that could not be broken .
am in a <UNK> club
we like to stop by at <UNK> near by motel when you go to a <UNK> city
there is so much to do here
including a pool
as well as a brick walk
the street down town was very busy .
there were a lot of people out that day .
the building at the edge of town had a lot of glass windows .
the cruise ship was <UNK> for a visit .
the building i wanted to see was being redone .
a man rode into town on his motorcycle .
he stayed at the location location .
on the way he saw a flag outside of a restaurant he later went to .
he then decided to visited the shore .
he walked on this stone path that led away from the land .
this trip was like a scene right out of a 50 's movie .
the motel was so old that it did n't even have air conditioning .
but , they did fly their flag everyday .
walking along the beach was breathtaking and very enjoyable .
walking on the <UNK> was a bit nerve <UNK> , but the view was worth it .
many bikers enjoyed parking their bikes to go to the beach .
before they would head out they made sure they had a hotel to put their stuff in .
once they were back at the beach they checked out all the nearby beach houses .
heading over to the beach they would see all kinds of people walking even cowboys .
the best part of the beach was walking on the old bridge that was made of broken up cement .
it was the day of the open house .
the <UNK> hired a <UNK> to stage the house .
every room looked lovely .
the basement , she left to their <UNK> .
as she drove away , she felt sure she would get an offer by the time she got back to
there was a huge house for sale yesterday .
i had a great time checking it out .
i really want to buy it .
there was a lot of space inside .
it was beautiful .
this nice couple was shopping for real estate .
the living room was well staged but a little hard to move around in .
the dining room had curtains that did n't match the living room .
the basement was partial finished , just perfect for a pool table .
it was out in the middle of nowhere , but maybe they would get lucky and gas prices would fall
we visited one of the newly built homes and it had both <UNK> and <UNK> .
the living room was very well decorated with plenty of light coming through the <UNK> windows .
the nearby family room had a modern fireplace and tv <UNK> but the <UNK> seemed off .
and the basement was not completed .
finally the neighboring lots are still empty creating a feeling of <UNK> .
we drove out to location to check out a house for sale .
we toured the model , which was beautiful . it was very elegant .
the marble fireplace was <UNK> impressive .
the finished <UNK> would house my pool table collection nicely .
however , the houses were pretty isolated in the middle of <UNK> . it 's a tough decisions .
when the sun rose , we began walking and browsing buildings outside .
this building was much closer to our destination .
inside , it looked a church or a court room .
their was such a large area of city and i was in awe .
along our route home , we ran into this interesting sculpture .
we went to see the art in the city that day .
the inside of the church was made us feel very <UNK> .
this sculpture was very strange yet captivating .
the lighting was extremely intense and illuminating .
we all posed for a photo before leaving .
a family visited a museum .
they saw the cathedral inside that was built into it .
some of the statues there were very creepy .
however , some of their exhibits were very cool .
at the end of the day , the family posed outside of the museum .
the girls walked up to the museum , excited about what they would find inside .
the entry way seemed to go for miles .
the sculptures inside were beautiful and unique .
she was taken <UNK> by the intricate designs .
they spent so much time inside that the sun had already gone down by the time they left .
traveling can bring you to the best of places .
you can get the chance to see beautiful buildings ,
and even go inside some of these buildings .
you can see them from afar ,
and you can see some fun statues that you ca n't find anywhere else . traveling can open you up
i have a friend from college who has been and architect for over 25 years now and he used to
i also love the old clock spires of yesterday and i have often stared in wonder at how they managed
even such things as indoor and outdoor lighting <UNK> and lantern holders are pieces of art to be admired today
the history of <UNK> and how they built walls and castles in the old days , to defend against their
brick was not just a <UNK> outside layer back in the old days because that was mostly all they had
for our vacation in location we got to see many tall buildings .
we stopped off an a local pub a few times and enjoyed a couple of beers .

the next day we stopped by some boats and did some sailing .
the guys spent there day visiting the city .
they stopped to get a beer when they got to their destination .
after the bar they stepped into the fresh air on this large green lawn .
they took the time to read the signs to direct them where to go next .
they ended the day at the marina .
[male] decided to travel around location .
along the way he found the great clock tower .
he had the opportunity to climb it , and it was awesome .
he also traveled out into the countryside
and found some great abandoned structures .
an old clock tower had not worked in many years it merely stood as an attraction .
the locals would talk and try to bring together many to repair it .
although the local churches were very empty with two buildings supporting it they did what they could .
they even brought it to court to see that the actions being taken were legal .
once fixed the residents of the town spent the rest of the day riding boats to celebrate their success on

i 'm pretty sure i 'm starting to feel like <UNK> .
the countryside and i are as one .
i can never get tired of sights like this .
i set off looking for my dream woman .
cruising around i think i may have just passed her .

the husband snapped a picture of the wife and the scenery behind her .
they saw a uniquely designed home and snapped a photo .
they went to see a beautiful clock tower while on vacation .
one of my many favorite vacation spots is an old town in location called location .

they did some crazy folk dances that you wanted to make fun of but you found yourself jumping in to
everywhere you look you can see eclectic <UNK> all over town . one thing is for sure you can never
we moved to a new town today and got a new apartment .
the city we moved to was small and quiet .
it was really pretty and had an old feel to it .
we were lucky enough to get an up stairs apartment .
which is great because now we always have a view of the city !
while shopping for a new place to live , we looked in the location section of town .
the view provided by the bedroom window overlooked a small portion of the neighborhood .
however the kitchen view was n't the greatest but we were more interested in the apartment than the view .
the staircase was <UNK> and looked to be in good working order .
the bathroom provided a nice view of the mountains in the distance .
this is the view from our hotel room . is n't this town adorable ?
some children 's art at the local museum .

the three of us decided to take a day trip to the vineyards .
the green countryside was beautiful .
we started seeing the vineyards as we passed by
the warehouse of wine was enormous .
nothing like a glass of wine with good friends to end the day .
our family posing at the start of the winery tour .

when [male] was moved to the location office , he got a much bigger office space .
he loved his new office , and the location atmosphere .
of course , he was as messy and disorganized as ever .
but the view of the location location was delightful .

the office was very organized .
a sign outside said where to go .
current events were on the bulletin board .

lots of important people worked in the building throughout history .

the teach showed some cool drawings on the board .
as i took a stroll around my <UNK> , i saw one of my neighbors house is close to a

this lady sat here for over an hour reading her bible , and she did not even notice me .
my daughter wanted a picture with the church as her background .

we said goodbye to the carnival on our final ride , the farris wheel . it lifted us high enough
the carnival in town has a lot of wonderful rides , some with neat faces created on them .
an awesome part of the show is the mirror maze .
a very popular ride is called the <UNK> , it flips you upside down .
a lot of people like to ride it at night as it is much more thrilling .
but ending the night on the organization wheel makes for a fun day at the carnival .

this is one of the crosses located on the inside . it 's my favorite .
last sunday we were in town trying to find some breakfast .
we eventually found a place that had just opened up for the day .
there were already a few customers inside .
afterward my family and i went to church .
we like going to church .
a group from the local church gathered at the warehouse to see a concert .
the band was great ! everyone had a lot of fun .
the show was winding down and folks started to get ready to leave .
outside , they had a conversation about their favorite moments from the concert .
they ended with a religious service to thank the lord for their fun , blessed day .
my friend and i were going to a small gathering together , we decided to meet at the warehouse .
as we walked in to the event , you can see small band and performing on stage .
guests were welcome to have some refreshment at the snack bar .
the event was hosted inside this white tall building .
the name of the building is the `` little church '' .
we went on a little adventure this weekend .
danced at the warehouse during the daylight
then got some fast food at a nearby mall .
what is this ? ? a chapel ?
a church ! we are going to get married here one day .
i took a trip to location location last summer to see the people of the area .
i was n't sure what to make of this guys clothes .
i did receive many dirty looks while photographing others .
this was one of my <UNK> , he did n't know that i took a picture of him .
this guy looked like he was in prison even though he was n't
after school i was sitting on the bench waiting for my bus to show up .
a friend of mine spotted me from across the street .
she saw the beads i was holding .
i quickly hid them by tossing them to another man and he hid them in his jacket .
but this guy saw the whole thing .
one day i was waiting on the bus and thinking about what to buy my wife for her birthday .
she is very important to me , so i need to get her something special .
i found a nice necklace that i think she will like .
i went and asked her dad , who i found praying outside .
he thinks she will like the necklace !
an old man is shopping at the market .
his friend is coming down the road to come and shop with him .
another talking on the phone about some things he saw at the market .
another man looking surprised what is going on with all this shopping .
and finally , this man decides to sit it out and not do any shopping .
sometimes i like to go out and people watch .
you can see some very beautiful women in this town .
you also can see some very <UNK> individuals .
some people seem alone and trapped in their <UNK> lives .
others like to enjoy a smoke with friends .
this is my house out in the country . you can see the sky in the background lit up from
here is a view from inside the city where the fireworks are being lit .
there goes another one !
the night sky is nice and clear to view the display .
here goes the last one for the night .
the odd red sky above the hotel we stayed at
<UNK> dark and now the red sky has gone away
<UNK> fireworks before it got dark and the big show began
the fireworks lit up the sky like some beautiful stars
these were my favorite classical fireworks during the finale
night is coming and this house was being shut down its family as the fireworks were tonight .
as the night got darker the street lights were coming on .
in the distance you can see one firework go off .
as we walk closer to town another firework has gone off .
we have reached our seats and the fireworks were going off with such beauty .
the family was having a nice get together for new years eye .
the weather was cold yet the sky was clear enough for fireworks .
the first firework went off at midnight with a bang .
soon after fireworks started appearing everywhere including downtown .
the family had so much fun that they did n't notice the sun rise .
[male] loved fireworks so much he always got a room in a bed and breakfast near the big fireworks display
it was a nice bed and breakfast , but the real appeal was the fireworks .
he would get so excited at the very first flare going up .
when the sky was filled with fireworks leftover light , his heart would sour .
each different firework was special to him . it was his favorite day of the year .
this is a very old house that has stood for centuries .
the <UNK> on the door is made very well .
this door has a more modern looking frame for the house number .
the colors and shape of this building contrast nicely with the sky .
when it gets darker , the building looks scary .
architecture from a time gone by is quite beautiful .
places of worship can be especially beautiful .
visiting places like this takes you back to a simpler time .
this church is lovely even though it is in disrepair .
the only think that brings you back in time is the image of modern <UNK> <UNK> the view of these
sight <UNK> take a picture of the <UNK> ,
they wanted to get every detail they could , even the address .
this one seemed out of place .
they get a view from right under .
then , they add a filter .
the church appeared ominous from this angle .
it was the wrong church . we were looking for <UNK> .
we made extra effort to check if it was really <UNK> .
we took a step back and admired the church .
clouds passed overhead and the church looked a little different .
many buildings in location were established in the early 1800 's .
some of the buildings still have their original door numbers .
owners often put designs in their doors .
this building was renovated with new paint .
it 's still in the process of renovation and construction .
visited the town of <UNK> today . it was cold but at least the sun was shining .
this is the marker claiming this is the largest , living longest christmas tree .
the organization organization . they do n't carry much but can order what you need .
organization organization and laundry . this is pretty much the entire town .
the old church in town . that is the end of our visit , it did n't take long .
the town of <UNK> has not changed much since the day it was formed .
the <UNK> is still in the same building as it was , although the house has changed .
this is the town 's infamous christmas tree ; the decorating ceremony is an important town event . the whole
the town hall and post office are run from the same simple building .
our modest town makes the church appear grand in comparison .
welcome to my hometown . allow me to show you around .
i remember always coming down to this christmas tree every year and everyone in town would help decorate it .
this is the general store .
i used to come here after school every single day . i do n't even remember where i got the
waking up to go to church every sunday was always so annoying . that 's probably why i no longer
the town of location in location location is a sleepy little town that has a unique claim to fame .
it is the home of the world 's largest living lit christmas tree .
i stayed in this bed and breakfast when i visited the town to see the tree lit in early <UNK>
the whole town gathered at this restaurant to have hot chocolate and cookies before the tree lighting ceremony .
after the tree was lit , those that wanted to could attend a christmas service in this small church .
someone buys a new camera and decides to test it out on his town sign .
then , he takes a picture of a memorial .
after that , he takes one of his local corner store .
then , a picture of town hall .
then , he gets one of the church
my husband and i went on vacation and found this quaint town .
it was christmas time and the town was getting ready to have their winter festival .
we were invited to take part in decorating the town tree .
the entire town went to the festival , everywhere else was deserted .
afterwards we went over to the train station to continue on our journey .
a bright gray sky hung over the town all day .
the people went about their business as usual .
the sky started to grow darker over the houses .
it looked like it would rain over the tower .
people cleared the roads in preparation for the rain .
a large tree marked the city 's business district .
many gathered around to enjoy the day 's festivities .
the city <UNK> woke up early to leave home and attend .
the building is one of the oldest in town .
after the event , everyone went home .
tourists explore the town and take pictures of the architecture and sights .
there are a lot of pretty buildings and architecture here .
there are also simple <UNK> structures like trees .
the streets are uniquely paved and set up .
the restaurants have a new and rural simple structure that makes them elegant looking .
although many people love visiting the <UNK> capitol , i have always found it depressing , with the narrow street
my hotel was lovely , but it only added to my depressed feeling to be there with all the happy
this tree seemed sad , alone in the middle of a cement forest .
the streets were often empty . everything seemed <UNK> of life .
i was eager to leave at the depot as soon as i could .
during the day , tour groups explored the city .
they saw the ferris wheel at dusk .
and the large square of screens at night .
after it all , they toasted with drinks .
finally , they decided to eat dinner .
the town 's square was so vibrant and full of life . it was lit up and full of people
there were so many interesting sites to see including the town 's famous bridge .
the architecture was amazing . so many beautiful old buildings .
the <UNK> were great too . we all got together and enjoyed a few drinks .
we also sampled some of the local pub fare . the snacks were delicious .
i went on a trip to location with a lot of college friends . i loved seeing the classic old
on a walk at night , i was overcome by the spooky beauty of the organization organization in the distance
the bright lights of the strip contrasted with the old parts of the city .
we all gathered at a pub for a toast to old times and new memories .
then we had a typical english food buffet . i must admit food was n't the best part of the
we decided to take a tour of the city
the cloud cover was a little disappointing but <UNK>
nightlife is always fun to try out
hanging out with friends a nice end to nice day
especially if sharing with good food
we began the grey day at the crack of dawn by attending church .
after a long , cold day of family celebrations the sun was setting and night began to fall .
heading downtown i began to feel excitement when the big cities lights began to light up the area .
we had a fantastic time sharing drinks with friends in a crowded bar .
the night ended with take out food and cigarettes being scattered throughout the living room after a night of drinks
the trip into the city made for a great walk .
we even saw some great art along the way .
as well as a sticky note oriented protest .
we stopped to have some great dessert at a restaurant .
on the walk home we could see a beautiful full moon .
we had arrived at the hotel , ready to get a good nights sleep before going into town tomorrow .
the next morning we went on a self guided art tour of the town . this particular piece is so
there was also some more traditional art that we saw on our tour .
my favorite art on the tour was some of the architecture that we saw on so many buildings , like
even our desert after the tour seemed to become a work of art . it had been a great day
this is the building i am trapped in , but i have a plan to escape .
with no guards around , i 'm climbing out of my window to freedom !
i <UNK> a car with sticky notes so i can escape easier and faster .
first place i stop was a dessert place that serves my favorite dish .
after that , i 'll travel through the night to wherever i want to go next .
we went on a sight-seeing trip , check out this old mill building we saw .
then we saw some amazing graffiti art ; it almost looks 3d .
there was a car that someone completely covered in <UNK> notes .
this really old building looks like a castle or a fortress .
after sight-seeing , we stopped and got some ice cream .
early this morning we left our loft apartment in the city .
we saw some strange art of a man <UNK> on to a window <UNK> .
shortly after , something even stranger : a car covered with <UNK> notes .
with that excitement out of the way , we stopped by a super fancy ice cream place .
we finished off the day with a breathtaking view of the cityscape at night .
we have a very old church near us that has beautiful stained glass windows .
these windows are so intricate , that they really are works of art .
and the sun coming in through them on sunday morning is beautiful .
the church has been here for decades and it is a part of the town 's history .
i hope it stays like this for future generations to see .
an old church i wanted to take pictures of today . i really like the black & white photos .
the back of the church . this part was added on years later .
the main stained glass window in the church . looks creepy in the dark .
a whole other window in the daylight . not scary at all , kind of calming .
this is one of my favorite ones in the church .
we went to church and had a great time together .
my family went to the church every sunday .
we felt closer as a family through the experience .
we left the church and went out to eat somewhere .
i always felt fulfilled after we went to church .
<UNK> windows are beautiful pieces of artwork .
they often portray scenes from the bible .
they come to life when the sun shines through the window .
they can be found in many older churches .
they are found in churches of all sizes .
we visited an <UNK> church .
there was huge ornate stained glass .
no priest was present that day .
the view outside was beautiful .
we really enjoyed it .
the train finally arrived .
we quickly jumped aboard and were ready for our journey .
it seemed like a short trip , taking three hours .
when we arrived , the weather had changed . it was snow covered ground .
we made our way to the hotel and looked forward to our vacation .
travel has always fascinated me . some people prefer trains .
others prefer to drive themselves .
some even like the subway .
you can always go grand on a ship .
i myself prefer to use my feet .
we were headed to work and had to wait on the train .
when it arrived , we had to wait on people to get off of it .
after everyone got off , we were able to get on .
as we was leaving , we noticed in that area it was covered in snow .
just down the tracks a bit , the snow had melted already .
we are going on a trip .
we waited for the train .
the bus station at our destination was busy .
when we arrived there was snow .
we had fun !
[female] was worried that the spy would follow her off of the train .
when she stepped out onto the platform , she saw a man looking her way , but was unsure if
she turned in walked the opposite direction , <UNK> to leave .
as she she left the station , she <UNK> to the snow to her home to hide .
she hid for the entire winter , until the snow melted away to water .
my friend begged me to sight see while we were overseas .
after i agreed , we encountered some unique statues atop buildings .
however , the statues during our window shopping were interesting as well .
even the statues along the streets were fun to look at .
she was very happy that we were able to explore before saying goodbye to the city .
we toured the factory today .
they had ceramic cat statues .
a concrete teddy bear statue was unique .
the entrance had gets structure .
they go through a process to make all the items in the factory .
the scary woman was looking very scared and spooky
a big statue of a brown lion holding of grey plate with the symbol
another 2 statues of two white cats
send a statue of a teddy bear sitting in a clay chair
scary lady is now waving goodbye to everyone
we took pictures of the old church today .
this lion was [female] 's favorite .
we found these cats in one of the empty rooms .
this bear was round the back .
this archway led to more houses behind the church .
this <UNK> loves to <UNK> about the people she turns into statues .
this is a man she turned into a lion because he was rude to her .
here are a couple of men who laughed at her , so she turned them into stone cats .
her favorite one was turning her lazy dad into a bear while he watched tv .
i realized why she brought me to see this . she waved her hand to say goodbye and i was
[female] went to visit a church on her vacation .
she did n't know what this monkey was supposed to represent , but she thought it was funny .
she thought the church was so beautiful she wanted a picture with it .
outside the church she decided to take a selfie
later she saw a statue that looked like her and took a picture with it .
the church had some beautiful stain glass .
as well as some amazingly carved pews .
we could also see an old church bell that was on display .
the statues cut an imposing silhouette .
it was a humbling experience .
the dark church was creepy in the <UNK> light .
the carvings in the wood shone strangely .
a girl asked her friend to take her picture in the dimly lit church .
her friend then took a selfie before getting creeped out .
they ran <UNK> it was much safer there .
i love visiting this old church , it helps me relax and i love the beautiful windows ,
this is one of my favorite pieces in the church , it makes me happy to see it .
i met a random girl while i was relaxing in the church , she seems to like me .
she got too close for comfort and tried to kiss me , not in my church ! <UNK>
i told her i was not interested in her at all and <UNK> her by a statue outside the church
the day was gloomy and the stained glass was made darker by the lack of light from the sun .
i realized , i must use my camera on my <UNK> so i could later identify the statues .
i was alone , but i could feel that i was being watched .
but always ready and willing for a selfie . maybe , they might think i 'm a tourist .
finally , i compared the statues . damn ! they do n't match . my search continues .
the old village had some ancient sights .
the walls were completely covered in moss .
as were the graves in the area .
some of the bricks were more moss than brick .
we even saw an ancient gravestone while we were there .
in the ancient cemetery , the dead do n't speak but the moss tells a story of slow , calm
it covers the headstones of villagers past , <UNK> to the <UNK> letters .
the moss makes a soft carpet on the hard , ancient stones , like a welcome mat to this foreboding
wherever it can find a shady spot , it <UNK> , like on the corners of this ancient staircase .
the moss has no <UNK> for who 's graves it covers , and does not care how [female] died .
there are many sacred places left from thousands of years ago all over the earth .
many of these sacred places are very <UNK> shaped and have a strange look .
some of these sacred places from our past appear to similar to tomb stones or monuments of more previous years
some of the sacred sites are more modern in that they show signs of skilled labor like block laying and
at many of these sights artifacts have been found which contain writing and are made of silver and gold .
i 've heard ancient stories of secret passages through these <UNK> rock areas .
some old writing within the moss , maybe it 's a clue or code to enter .
the clue told me to push the green brick to enter a special chamber .
i pushed the brick and it opened to these old <UNK> stairs , i 'll follow them .
it lead me to this sacred burial ground , it 's full of treasures and <UNK> beyond your imagination .
we went to check out an old graveyard .
there was moss growing on everything .
we saw a really old stone wall .
we saw some old stairs that looked like they took a lot of work to make .
then we saw a huge grave marker that must have been really expensive back in the day .
the family takes a vacation to the beautiful coast line .
the waves come in from the ocean and pound the shores .
watching a sunset from the beach is always a fantastic way to end the day .
then as darkness falls , the lights come on in the bay to celebrate .
all in all , this family had a great day at the coast .
the view was amazing from he car .
the rocks and water just smelled so good .
the sun was shining just right .
the water was so blue and peaceful .
this was the prettiest shot i got that day .
we walked along the sidewalk to get to the beach .
this was the house we were staying in .
we loved the feeling of the sand between our toes .
we got our swimsuits on and dove in .
we spotted some fish in this little part .
we came across some buildings down by the ocean .
the view from the buildings was so relaxing .
we stayed long enough to watch the sun set .
at night we came across some christmas lights displayed in the water .
it was really cold at night by the water .
this is the place we 're visiting on the water .
the waves generally keep us up at night .
but the sunsets make it worth all the noise !
once the sun sets we hit the nearby town to see the light displays .
they were so gorgeous we needed to take a picture with them !
we decided to go for a drive . i liked how the ice stuck to the trees .
this field was totally frozen over .
the mountain in the distance looked very cold and foreboding .
this was the wall in front of someone 's house .
i liked this tree the best , looked like the perfect christmas tree !
the woods near my house are so pretty
especially after the first snow fall
its like a winter wonderland
someday i would like to go up to the mountain
there is an amazing castle i would go to
the sun started finally appearing after a few snowy winter days .
you could look out over the field and see the snow melting .
the mountain in the distant looked lush and green after the snow melted .
a fence still held some snow on top of it .
some areas of the ground were still covered in snow where the sun had n't shone on them yet .
the new snowfall covered the ground .
it was n't very much .
in some places , the sun had already melted it .
other places , it was still barely on the ground .
it was pretty thick in my backyard however .
there was an ice storm last night and it made everything look beautiful .
the woods by the lake looked like an enchanted forest .
the ice on the branches <UNK> in the sunlight like stars .
looking out upon the valley , the mountain in the distance appeared to float in the air .
the <UNK> willow by the cemetery looked as if it were alive . ice storms are dangerous but the aftermath
we walked towards the entrance to an amazing cathedral .
the years it must have taken to create this .
the details of the ceiling was breathtaking .
looking straight up it seemed you were looking forever .
the final part of the church was the courtyard in the middle .
the church was the most beautiful building in the square .
the inside was just as beautifully decorated .
in the front was an ornate alter .
the church had seating for many people .
the tour of the church ended with the viewing of a well kept courtyard .
this place is beautiful on the outside .
it is just as beautiful on the inside .
so much work went into making this so beautiful .
i would love to see this filled with people in celebration .
a nice place to congregate when you are done inside .
[female] valentine went to location on vacation . she visited an amazing mansion .
the mansion had artwork on the ceiling and wherever she walked she looked up .
she loved the doors and the archways . she wanted to buy the mansion , but could n't afford it
she walked into a wing of the mansion that had very interesting details . she noticed it looked like <UNK>
she noticed a small lawn with a funny shape . she had heard that the shape was associated with an
although we were tired of sightseeing , when it looked like a bad storm was approaching we <UNK> into the
there , we were stunned by the beauty inside .
it was remarkable that human <UNK> and relatively <UNK> tools had constructed such a building .
we realized it was deep religious feelings and the desire to express these feelings that inspired the <UNK> and workers
as we stepped into a courtyard and looked upon the expansive sky , it was easy to see how they
it was an amazing trip , going back home after all of these years .
the wall around the house was beginning to <UNK> .
walking through the gate was like meeting an old friend .
the yard is full of all of my family members that have gone before me .
i sit out back and think about one day coming home to stay .
the old church has a graveyard
this was the first house in the county turned into a church
the original settlers are buried here
most of the <UNK> still live in the area
the gate has been here for over 100 years
there was an old cemetery behind the local church .
this church was built from the 1800 's .
the graves were older .
the writing on the headstones were almost all weathered away .
there was an old stone gate leading into it .
i returned to my old house that day .
it still looked exactly as it used to , except it was a church now .
the cemetery nearby was depressing to see again .
the house was really beautiful though and i remembered my childhood there .
i finally left and traveled back home .
the church was white
and there were rocks near .
the gate was big
and there was a home near
that was a cemetery home .
we were finally ready to visit the <UNK> wall surrounding the ruins of [male] [male] 's temple .
it was awe inspiring .
people of many cultures praying to their own <UNK> .
side by side at the wall .
i wish i could hear the stories this ancient wall could tell .
they did n't usually gather outside for prayer , but this was an important occasion .
a lot of people showed up .
some of them <UNK> around , unsure of what they were supposed to be doing .
two of the men examined the ancient wall .
a few others were deep in prayer , and one read aloud from a book .
my family and i went to location for vacation .
we arrived at the holy wall and it was amazing .
there were many people <UNK> in front of the wall .
people would get right up close to the wall and pray to themselves .
the wall did n't have any <UNK> visible <UNK> features . it was just a stone wall .
grandma and grandpa took us to a biblical reenactment !
it was kind of scary on some parts .

some continued to pray at whatever cross they found .
others met at the windmill to discuss the matter .

the debris from the storm was piled up everywhere .
i went out after the storm ended , and a heavy mist still hung over everything .
the storm came in out of nowhere .
the trees were blowing and rain was pouring down .
i could n't believe how bad it was raining there .
it caused so much damage during the rain .
i could hardly see down to the end of the street .
i 've never seen such thick fog , i had to document it .

you could get just one or get a lot .
you could stack them and <UNK> them to your individual liking .
they called them mini cakes instead of cup cakes .
